Their music is characterized by Durst's aggressive vocal style and Borland's experimental guitar work. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, sold 40 million records worldwide, and received multiple other awards.\n\nThe band was formed in 1994 by Durst and bassist Sam Rivers and was soon joined by Otto and later Borland. Limp Bizkit gained recognition in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s and signed with Flip Records, distributed by Interscope, releasing their debut album \"Three Dollar Bill, Y'all\" in 1997. They achieved mainstream success with the albums \"Significant Other\" (1999) and \"Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water\" (2000), though their rise was accompanied by controversies related to performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.\n\nBorland left the band in 2001, and Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued with guitarist Mike Smith. Following the release of their fourth album \"Results May Vary\" (2003), Borland returned to record the EP \"The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1)\" (2005) with Durst, Rivers, Lethal, and drummer Sammy Siegler before the band went on hiatus. In 2009, Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland and resumed touring, culminating in the release of \"Gold Cobra\" (2011). The band subsequently left Interscope, signed with Cash Money Records, and saw DJ Lethal briefly leave before returning in 2018. After years of teasing an album tentatively titled \"Stampede of the Disco Elephants,\" they released their sixth studio album \"Still Sucks\" on October 31, 2021. Founding bassist Sam Rivers, who recruited Otto into the band, died in October 2025.\n\nLimp Bizkit has released 26 singles, with notable tracks including \"Nookie,\" \"Re-Arranged,\" \"Break Stuff,\" \"Take a Look Around,\" \"Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle),\" \"My Generation,\" \"My Way,\" \"Eat You Alive,\" and a cover of The Who's 1971 single \"Behind Blue Eyes,\" all of which have reached the top 20 of the US Alternative Airplay Chart.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limp_Bizkit\n\nStudio albums\nThree Dollar Bill, Y'all (1997)\nSignificant Other (1999)\nChocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000)\nResults May Vary (2003)\nGold Cobra (2011)\nStill Sucks (2021) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Limp+Bizkit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
