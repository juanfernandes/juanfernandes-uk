The current lineup consists of Shaffer (guitar), Brian \"Head\" Welch (guitar), Jonathan Davis (vocals), and Ray Luzier (drums), who replaced Silveria in 2007. Korn is recognized for pioneering and popularizing the nu metal genre.\n\nThe band recorded a demo tape, \"Neidermayer's Mind,\" in 1993, which was distributed to record companies and on request to the public. Their debut album, \"Korn,\" was released in 1994, followed by \"Life Is Peachy\" in 1996. Korn achieved mainstream success with \"Follow the Leader\" (1998) and \"Issues\" (1999), both of which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Subsequent albums included \"Untouchables\" (2002), \"Take a Look in the Mirror\" (2003), and \"See You on the Other Side\" (2005).\n\nA compilation album, \"Greatest Hits Vol. 1,\" was released in 2004, marking the end of the band's contract with Immortal Records and Epic Records. They signed with Virgin Records, releasing \"See You on the Other Side\" in 2005 and an untitled album in 2007. Later releases include \"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\" (2010) and \"The Path of Totality\" (2011) via Roadrunner Records, and \"The Paradigm Shift\" (2013) via Prospect Park and Caroline Records. They returned to Roadrunner Records for \"The Serenity of Suffering\" (2016) and \"The Nothing\" (2019). Their most recent album, \"Requiem,\" was released through Loma Vista Recordings on February 4, 2022.\n\nAs of 2021, Korn had sold over 40 million records worldwide. Several of their releases have been certified gold, platinum, or multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Fourteen of their official releases have reached the top ten of the Billboard 200, with eight reaching the top five. The band has won two Grammy Awards from eight nominations and two MTV Video Music Awards from 11 nominations. Several of their music videos, including \"Got the Life\" and \"Freak on a Leash,\" received extensive play on MTV's Total Request Live and were among the first videos retired on the show.\n\nFull Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn\n\nStudio albums\nKorn (1994)\nLife Is Peachy (1996)\nFollow the Leader (1998)\nIssues (1999)\nUntouchables (2002)\nTake a Look in the Mirror (2003)\nSee You on the Other Side (2005)\nUntitled (2007)\nKorn III: Remember Who You Are (2010)\nThe Path of Totality (2011)\nThe Paradigm Shift (2013)\nThe Serenity of Suffering (2016)\nThe Nothing (2019)\nRequiem (2022) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Korn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
