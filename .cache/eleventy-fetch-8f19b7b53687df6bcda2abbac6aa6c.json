It was released on February 6, 2003, by Shady Records, G-Unit Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. After signing with Eminem, 50 Cent also worked heavily with Dr. Dre, with the duo acting as the album's executive producers, who worked to combine the gangsta rap and R&B combo prevalent in New York hip hop. Additional production is provided by Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL, Mr. Porter, Rockwilder, Dirty Swift, and Megahertz.\n\nThe album also contains guest appearances from Eminem, Young Buck, and Nate Dogg, as well as features from G-Unit co-members Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be his debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until he signed with Eminem's Shady Records in 2002.\n\nReleased a week in advance to combat bootlegging and internet leakage, Get Rich or Die Tryin' debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album's singles also saw commercial success, with both \"In da Club\" and \"21 Questions\" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while \"P.I.M.P.\" became a number one hit in several countries. The album was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End 2003 and received generally positive reviews from music critics.\n\nGet Rich or Die Tryin' was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2000s. In 2020, it was certified 9× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the best-selling album of 2003 in the US, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at 2003 American Music Awards and Top Billboard 200 Album at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nPrior to the release of his mix-tape, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York on May 24, 2000. He managed to survive, but was dropped from his label, Columbia Records, and remained unsigned and in need of producing new music. In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cent's Guess Who's Back? mix-tape album through Jackson's attorney, who was working with Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where he was introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one million dollar record deal with Dr. Dre and released his next mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured the 8 Mile single, \"Wanksta\", which was later put on Get Rich or Die Tryin'. Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started working-productions on his debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL among others.\n\nThe first single \"In da Club\" was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on a couple songs, such as \"Patiently Waiting\" and \"Don't Push Me\". His songs also featured rappers within G-Unit, such as Lloyd Banks (\"Don't Push Me\"), Tony Yayo (\"Like My Style\"), or Young Buck (\"Blood Hound\"). The next single \"21 Questions\" was not in line to be on the album to Dr. Dre, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, \"Dre was, like, 'How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?'\" 50 Cent responded saying, \"I'm two people. I've always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that's not diversity, it's necessity.\" \"Back Down\" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim's debut Aftermath album, Oh My God, but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of Get Rich or Die Tryin' included a limited edition bonus DVD. A music video for \"Many Men (Wish Death)\" was made. The song was also certified Gold by the RIAA on June 14, 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/Get+Rich+or+Die+Tryin%27\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
