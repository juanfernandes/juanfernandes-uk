Initially performing under the name Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids, the group gained a local following in South Florida during the early 1990s through their theatrical and provocative live performances. In 1993, they became the first act signed to Trent Reznor’s Nothing Records label. Until 1996, each band member adopted a stage name combining the first name of a female celebrity and the last name of a male criminal, such as Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson. The band’s lineup has changed frequently throughout its career, with Marilyn Manson remaining the sole constant member.\n\nKnown for elaborate costumes, heavy makeup, and shocking stage imagery, the band became a focus of controversy due to its lyrics and performances, which often addressed themes of religion, sexuality, violence, and drug use. Several of their concerts were met with protests, and some U.S. states enacted temporary restrictions on their performances in state-owned venues. Marilyn Manson achieved major commercial success with albums such as \"Antichrist Superstar\" (1996) and \"Mechanical Animals\" (1998), both of which were certified multi-platinum. Their visually distinctive music videos and extensive touring further cemented their prominence in rock music during the late 1990s.\n\nIn 1999, the band was falsely accused by segments of the media of influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, leading to widespread controversy and public debate. Although the band’s mainstream visibility declined in the following decade, Marilyn Manson continued to record and tour, maintaining a dedicated fan base.\n\nMarilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records worldwide and achieved ten top-ten albums in the United States, including two that reached number one. They have been nominated for four Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame in 2000, and were ranked 78th on VH1’s list of the 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band and its frontman are widely regarded as influential figures in both rock and popular culture.\n\nStudio albums\nPortrait of an American Family (1994)\nAntichrist Superstar (1996)\nMechanical Animals (1998)\nHoly Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) (2000)\nThe Golden Age of Grotesque (2003)\nEat Me, Drink Me (2007)\nThe High End of Low (2009)\nBorn Villain (2012)\nThe Pale Emperor (2015)\nHeaven Upside Down (2017)\nWe Are Chaos (2020)  \nOne Assassination Under God - Chapter 1 (2024) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Marilyn+Manson\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
