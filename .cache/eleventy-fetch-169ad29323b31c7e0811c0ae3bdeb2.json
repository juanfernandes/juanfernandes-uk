The album heavily samples dialogue from the martial arts film Shogun Assassin and maintains a dark atmosphere throughout its course, while it incorporates lyrical references to chess, crime and philosophy. Liquid Swords features numerous guest appearances from the entire nine piece Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nUpon its release, Liquid Swords peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart, and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. On January 11, 1996, it was certified gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).  The album initially received favorable critical reviews for its lyrically complex and musically hypnotic style. Over the years, its recognition has grown, with a number of famous publishers proclaiming it as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. In 2007, the Chicago Tribune cited it as \"one of the most substantial lyrical journeys in hip-hop history\". Along with Raekwon's Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..., Liquid Swords is often cited as the best solo Wu-Tang work. In 2010, GZA and RZA announced that they are working on a sequel to commemorate its 15th-year anniversary. A remastered deluxe chess box set version was released on July 24, 2012. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/GZA%2FGenius/Liquid+Swords\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
