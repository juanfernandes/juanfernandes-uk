    "brief": "<h4>üß© Project Summary</h4> <p>The National College needed a responsive, modern website to support educators with accessible training and certification tools. I was brought on by Synergi Tech to translate their in-house design concepts into clean, scalable front-end code‚Äîensuring brand consistency, device responsiveness, and WCAG accessibility throughout the experience.</p> <h4>üéØ The Challenge</h4> <p>The goal was to deliver a fast, frictionless learning portal that felt both welcoming and professional‚Äîsupporting busy teachers across a variety of devices and browsers. Designs were visually well-considered but needed front-end precision and accessibility implementation to ensure the site performed as reliably as it looked.</p> <p>Additionally, the site needed to be lightweight and performant, using a static-site generator (11ty) and utility-first styling (TailwindCSS) to keep delivery fast and maintainable.</p> <h4>üõ†Ô∏è My Approach</h4> <ol><li><b>Front-End Architecture with Reusability in Mind</b><br> Using 11ty and TailwindCSS, I built out modular, responsive components that could be reused across page templates‚Äîminimising duplication and easing future iteration.</li><li><b>Pixel-Perfect Translation of Figma Designs</b><br>Working closely with the client‚Äôs designer, I recreated visual layouts with accuracy, ensuring spacing, typography, and hierarchy matched the intended tone and voice of the brand.</li><li><b>Accessibility by Design</b><br>Every component was designed to meet WCAG AA standards. Semantic HTML, focus states, colour contrast, and keyboard navigation were baked in from the start‚Äîhelping create an inclusive experience for all users.</li><li><b>Stakeholder Feedback Loops</b>I collaborated weekly with stakeholders to gather feedback and refine features. This agile feedback process helped us resolve usability snags early, particularly around mobile breakpoints and interaction patterns.</li></ol> <h4>üì± Outcomes</h4> <ul><li>Fully responsive UI that performs seamlessly across devices</li><li>Accessible, inclusive markup built to WCAG AA standards</li><li>Lightweight static site built with performance-first architecture</li><li>Clean, component-based design system for long-term maintainability</li><li>Positive stakeholder feedback on delivery quality and turnaround</li></ul> <h4>üí° Why This Matters</h4> <p>In fast-paced, time-poor industries‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs education or banking‚Äîusers don‚Äôt have the luxury to ‚Äúfigure things out.‚Äù They need clarity, simplicity, and confidence in the tools they rely on.</p><p>This project reflects the kind of work I enjoy most: taking strong visual ideas and turning them into intuitive, accessible, and performance-optimised digital products.</p>"
