    "quote": "I asked Juan to redesign Property With Potential with the intent of improving the mobile experience and increasing user engagement. However, I needed <b>more than just a designer</b> since I wanted it delivered in a templating language that was compatible with our system, and to use Tailwind CSS. Juan rose to the challenge, learning Tailwind, introducing me to Alpine JS, and continuously delivering to Netlify and GitLab. There's nothing better as a developer than to work with someone that just 'gets it'; someone who can collaborate, work independently, and deliver. The new design has <b>significantly improved our performance</b> and <b>accessibility metrics</b>, and improved our ad revenue. If you need someone to hit the ground running and work with your existing team, <b>hire him</b>.",
