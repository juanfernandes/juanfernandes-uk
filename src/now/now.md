## Personal
* Not dating anymore. :)

## Work
* Work wise - that's not good either, last year my role was changed from Front-end Dev to UX/UI Designer and this year, a few months ago we finally got a Head of UX. I've tried doing the UX role and I don't like it. I like designing with UX in mind, but not doing all the research or all the written work etc.
