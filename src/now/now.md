## Work
* Started a new project at work and I get to do UX things properly. I'm also finding what I like and don't about UX processes.

## Personal
* Now the weather has started to improve, I've been working on tidying up the garden and also the outside entertainment area - ready to put on a big BBQ this summer for family and friends.

## Watching
* [Fallout](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/106379-fallout "Fallout")
  The story of haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have. 200 years after the apocalypse, the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind — and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird, and highly violent universe waiting for them.

* [Dexter](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1405-dexter "Dexter")
  Rewatch: Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Metro Police also leads a secret life as a serial killer, hunting down criminals who have slipped through the cracks of justice.

* [Loudermilk](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73200-loudermilk "Loudermilk")
  Sam Loudermilk is a recovering alcoholic and substance abuse counselor with an extremely bad attitude about, well, everything. He is unapologetically uncensored, and manages to piss off everyone in his life. Although he has his drinking under control, Loudermilk discovers that when your life is a complete mess, getting clean is the easy part.

* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.
