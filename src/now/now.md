### Personal
* My attempt at cutting out a shape, my first name in a stencil font, failed! But it was a fun experiment. I successfully, but 100% perfectly managed to cut out my name with a blade knife, but when I was holding the grip tape over the board, it started to stretch the letters. So I guessed the centre and placed the grip tape down, unfortunately, it wasn't in the centre. Tried to peel it off and it ripped because of where the letters were cut out, it was weakened. I have resolved this by buying a seethrough grip tape to allow the colour of my board to be visible.

### Work
* Nothing much has changed with work. I feel stuck as things do not appear to be getting better, and the current economic state of the UK makes my options limited.
