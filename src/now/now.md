## Work
* Work is finally picking up and we're doing a lot more talking about UX and new processes which is great as there hasn't been any UX processes in place - ever.

## Personal
* Working on my website again this week - mostly tinkering and then working on the new design, but first need to continue my design research.

## Watching

* [Loudermilk](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73200-loudermilk "Loudermilk")
  Sam Loudermilk is a recovering alcoholic and substance abuse counselor with an extremely bad attitude about, well, everything. He is unapologetically uncensored, and manages to piss off everyone in his life. Although he has his drinking under control, Loudermilk discovers that when your life is a complete mess, getting clean is the easy part.

* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.
