## Personal
* Daughter and I went to the UEFA Women's FA Cup final match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur - it was a great game. We had a great time travelling into London, just the two of us, and then we met up with other children and parents from my daughters' football team.

## Watching

* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose.
