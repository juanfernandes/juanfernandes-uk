### Work
- My contract with Signet Jewlers in Borehamwood, North London came to an end in mid-November, it was due to end on October 31st but it was extended by another week, which gave an opportunity to do some code refinements and minor bug fixes.
- The migration of my websites' CMS from Perch to [11ty](https://11ty.io "11ty")</a> is now complete - but I'm now working on improvements to some of the existing code and I've also started getting rid of my old grid system in favour of using CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox.

### Play
Still playing Minecraft - we have now moved our minecraft world to a Minecraft Realms server, we get a lot of power cuts, our server would shutdown and the kids didn't know how to get minecraft back up and running, its working out great - I can now jump on and play with the kids while I am away on contracts.

We have defeated the Ender Dragon!

### Reading
- I'm continuing Stephen King's - The Dark Tower books, now reading book number 5 - [Wolves of the Calla](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4978.Wolves_of_the_Calla "Wolves of the Calla")

- Always reading web design and business articles via my Instapaper
