### Personal
* Continued working on installing the laminate flooring in one of the new rooms in the recent loft conversion. After a slow start and a few busy weekends not working on this, I have finally got over half way done. Will hopefully get it finished this coming weekend.
* Since joining mastodon a few years ago I was on the mastodon.social instance - this is one of the more common ones most people join and with the recent influx of ex-twitter users, a lot of other instances have started blocking mastodon.social which would me people wouldn't see any of my posts etc. So All this to say I have moved to [hachyderm.io](https://www.hachyderm.io "hachyderm.io") and with that I had to redo my IFTTT.com webhooks and recipes for auto posting to the Fediverse from my website.
