### Personal
* Rented a storage unit to store all the things I still have at the house as I can store them at my flat.

### Projects
* Finally migrated this websites' CMS from Forestry to Tina. Wasn't a straight forward migration as its built to work with NextJS frameworks but they're working on SSG frameworks as well.

### Reading
* [The Outsider by Stephen King](https://bookwyrm.social/book/36200/s/the-outsider "The Outsider by Stephen King")
* [Company of One](https://bookwyrm.social/book/184714/s/company-of-one "Company of One")
* Always reading web design and business articles via my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/juanfernandes "Juan Fernandes on Instapaper")
