### Personal
* I have now been living in my rented flat for a little over a month, and I pretty much have bought everything I needed so far. I feel pretty settled in the new place and town.

### Reading
* [The Outsider by Stephen King](https://bookwyrm.social/book/36200/s/the-outsider "The Outsider by Stephen King")
* [Company of One](https://bookwyrm.social/book/184714/s/company-of-one "Company of One")
* Always reading web design and business articles via my [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/p/juanfernandes "Juan Fernandes on Instapaper")

### Watching
* [Black Knight](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/137040 "Black Knight")
  In a dystopian 2071 devastated by air pollution, the survival of humanity depends on the Black Knights — and they’re far from your average delivery men.

#### Finished
* [Seinfeld (Rewatch)](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1400-seinfeld "Seinfeld")
* [Unstable](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/219788-unstable "Unstable")
