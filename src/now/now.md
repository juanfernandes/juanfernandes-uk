### Personal
* More changes with home/family life - now all three of my children are living with me, which is great, but we are having to live in a tiny two-bed flat!

### Projects
* Been doing a lot of work on my ecommerce side project. Have done a soft launch and will be working on getting the word out about it soon.
* Added a script that fetches the last 10 articles I've read, which you can now see in the new Articles section bellow.

### Watching
