### Personal
* Ended up in hospital on Monday last week - nothing serious - just turns out the excruciating pain I had is kidney stones. Haven't had pain anywhere near as bad since - so I assume it passed.
* Got stuck into Finders Keepers and ended up not being able to put it down. Now started reading the 3rd book in the Bill Hodges trilogy by Stephen King.
* At the end of last week, one of our chickens’ eggs finally hatched, then a day later a second. On the third day, she gave up on the other eggs. Another was born but it didn’t make it. I got all the other eggs and was taking them to the compost bin and I heard chirping. There was one still in one of the eggs. I cracked the top of it gently and exposed the chick. The mom pecked at it once and ignored it. So I removed the rest of the egg shell and got the chick out but mom still ignored it, so we took the chick inside and put it in a tub under a heat lamp. The chicken went from a curled up unfeathered chick to a fluffy chick in a few days and today I put her in with mom and the others.
