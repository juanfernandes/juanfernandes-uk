## Personal
* Summer holidays are over as they're back to school this week. I had an extra long weekend - Friday and Monday off as I was supposed to be going somewhere, but it got cancelled, I still enjoyed the break.

* Got rid of my Digital Ocean droplet to try and save some money. I was using it to host a Nextcloud instance, but I figured I could just host it locally instead.

* **[Dexter](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1405-dexter "Dexter")**
