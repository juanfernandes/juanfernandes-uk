## Personal
* Mudt have caught a cold whilst away in Kent last weekend as I've had one all week. And to top it all pff, I lost a filling so have also had toothache to deal with. Yay.

## Work
* Focusing on two pieces of design work. One is a small design fix, but the other is a bigger piece which involves an integration with a third party video provider - feels good to actually have something to make you think.

## Watching
* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.

* [Dexter](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/1405-dexter "Dexter")
  Rewatch: Dexter Morgan, a blood spatter pattern analyst for the Miami Metro Police also leads a secret life as a serial killer, hunting down criminals who have slipped through the cracks of justice.

* [Loudermilk](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73200-loudermilk "Loudermilk")
  Sam Loudermilk is a recovering alcoholic and substance abuse counselor with an extremely bad attitude about, well, everything. He is unapologetically uncensored, and manages to piss off everyone in his life. Although he has his drinking under control, Loudermilk discovers that when your life is a complete mess, getting clean is the easy part.
