### Personal
* I've successfully applied the seethrough grip tape to my new skateboard and it looks great. Not a perfect job, but not bad for a first attempt. Trucks back on and ready for some skateboarding!
* Went to a golf range for the first time with a friend and their family. Was a great day out and lots of fun. My son loved it and we will be going back.
* Got back into NFTs by buying a new one. Nice little project and cool artwork. Had lost interest in NFTs for a bit due to lots of projects disapearing.
