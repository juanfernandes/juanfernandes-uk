### Work
* Work is finally picking up and we're doing a lot more talking about UX and new processes which is great as there hasn't been any UX processes in place - ever.

### Personal
* Still no progress on selling the house, other than we have a meeting with someone who specialises in selling expensive houses. Fingers crossed this works and quickly as I'm really struggling to keep up with mortgage payments and bills on my own.

* This week, my girlfriend and I will be celebrating our 1-year anniversary - we're going for a meal at our favourite restaurant. ❤️

### Watching
* [Loudermilk](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73200-loudermilk "Loudermilk")
  Sam Loudermilk is a recovering alcoholic and substance abuse counselor with an extremely bad attitude about, well, everything. He is unapologetically uncensored, and manages to piss off everyone in his life. Although he has his drinking under control, Loudermilk discovers that when your life is a complete mess, getting clean is the easy part.

* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.

* [Wellmania](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/195841-wellmania "Wellmania")
  When a health crisis forces Liv to rethink her “live fast, die young” attitude, she jumps into a wellness journey to get better — even if it kills her.

* [Inside Man](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/121710-inside-man "Inside Man")
  A prisoner on death row in the US, a vicar in a quiet English town, and a maths teacher trapped in a cellar cross paths in the most unexpected way.
