### Work
* Still early days but nothing's changed at work yet - my new boss got this message from a Business Analyst in the business "I have created a certain rough layouts using Paint; could you please review them and suggest the changes required as per the design standards." - this was sent to the Head of UX!

### Personal
* Desperately trying to sell the family home as my ex-wife has lost her job and can't pay half of the mortgage - so I have to pay all of it and also feed my 3 children and pay all the bills. Its getting difficult.

### Watching
* [Loudermilk](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/73200-loudermilk "Loudermilk")
  Sam Loudermilk is a recovering alcoholic and substance abuse counselor with an extremely bad attitude about, well, everything. He is unapologetically uncensored, and manages to piss off everyone in his life. Although he has his drinking under control, Loudermilk discovers that when your life is a complete mess, getting clean is the easy part.

* [Inside Man](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/121710-inside-man "Inside Man")
  A prisoner on death row in the US, a vicar in a quiet English town, and a maths teacher trapped in a cellar cross paths in the most unexpected way.

* [Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")
  To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.
