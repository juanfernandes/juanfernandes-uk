### Work
* Working on the project I can't say much about other than its getting more intense now as the devs have now caught up with me (they are building the pages; while I create the HTML and CSS). I had a headstart, but its just me working with a few developers.

### Personal
* Turns out one of the new rooms in the loft is too small for what we originally planned it for, a cinema/gaming room. It will now our eldest daughters bedroom (that's what she wanted right from the start). Her current bedroom will then become our cinema room; which gives us a lot more room to play with!
