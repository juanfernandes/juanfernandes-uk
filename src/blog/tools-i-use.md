I love these posts that show what designers and developers use to do their job - so I thought I'd post my own. It's been a long while since I last wrote anything, so thought this would be an easy one to get me back into writing.

_Update: These are the tools I like to use, it's ones I use when I can, but as a contractor I am used to adapting and using what ever tools the client needs me to use. So don't feel that just because I like a MacBook doesn't mean I can't use Windows._ ðŸ˜Š

## Web Design
### Editor
My editor of choice is  [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/ "Sublime Text 3") using the [Seti theme & colour scheme](https://github.com/ctf0/Seti_ST3 "Seti Theme & Colour Scheme") with whole bunch of add-ons and [custom settings](https://gist.github.com/juanfernandes/ba413678c7686f0c96b0#file-03_user_preferences-txt "Sublime Text Preferences"). I'm happy with ST3 and I know there are other editors, like the new VS Code, but ST3 is not broken for me, so I don't need to change it.  

### Terminal
For terminal emulation I have just started using [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/ "iTerm 2") - previously when using Ubuntu, I just used the default terminal - I tried [Hyper](https://hyper.is/ "Hyper") but I didn't get on with it. 

I have always used Bash but now on the MBP, I'm trying out [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/ "Fish shell") and [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish "Oh My Fish").

## Desktop Apps
For design I use [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org "GIMP") - Adobe Photoshop is far too expensive, does not work on Linux (which is what I've used for the past 10 years) and I never used more than 10% of its features. 

I still have to use FTP for some clients, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org "FileZilla FTP") has been my FTP client of choice for a long time.

My development browser is Chrome - it has great developer tools and it's faster than Firefox. I have Firefox and Opera for testing. Firefox is my main browser.

For notes and writing, I use [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com "Simplenote"). It's cross-platform, which means all my notes are available on my phone, on the internet and my laptop.
 
Slack and Skype for communication. Currently trying out [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/ "Franz") - an app that houses other apps, like Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, Skype and more, all under one app.

## Desk Setup
My development machine is a 15" MacBook Pro 2018 with 32gb of ram and its plugged into a 21" Samsung monitor. I've only had the MBP for about a month. My previous machine was a 15" Toshiba Satellite Pro with 16gb ram - It was about 4 years old.

## Other Gear
My phone is a OnePlus 5T
For testing responsive websites I build, I use the following mobiles and tablets:
- iPhone 4s
- iPhone 5s
- LG Nexus 4
- LG G3
- Google Pixel 3
- OnePlus 5T
- Kindle Fire 10
- iPad Mini

Not forgetting notepads, pens and pencils! 

Have you written a similar post? I'd love to read about your setup.
