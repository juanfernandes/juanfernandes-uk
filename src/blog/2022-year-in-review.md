<p class="lead">This year in review post has been really difficult to write because of how it ended with being the worst year of my life, so far. It took me a while to write it but I really didn't want to miss posting it as I've written one every year since 2016.</p>

## Work
Not much freelave work done this year as I stepped back from doing so much, just focused on contract work.

- Finished [Arrival Lift Services](https://www.arrival-lifts.co.uk/ "Arrival Lift Services") website - a custom design and build using Tailwind CSS and Eleventy

- Removed Forestry CMS from JF website because I wasn't using it anymore and its also being discontinued. Now that I'm back to using an iPhone, there are GitLab apps that allowed me to edit content on my repo, but this was quite a fiddly way to edit and add content to my website. I then added Forestry back because of Stream (Short posts that get syndicated to social media) posts as a temporary solution whilst I look into getting [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/ "Tina CMS") setup

- For a long time I used the project-hub.xyz domain name to host projects I was working on, as a way to show clients progress that was made - with a backlog of changes kept for reference. But since I've stopped doing freelance work it was time to get rid of it. I tried selling the domain name but there was no interest so I let it expire :(
