After almost three years of being on the Apple eco system (MacBook, iPhone, iWatch and AirPods - I've had enough.

The latest changes to iOS have broken so many things for me that just makes the iPhone useless. 

It's riddled with bugs and terrible UX. Not to mention so many broken UI elements too. 

Back to Android for me, this time I'm going to try a Samsung phone.
