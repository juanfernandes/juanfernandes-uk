title: Should I continue with my monthly notes?
description: >-
  For most of 2023 my monthly notes posts have contained a lot more personal
  content and not a lot web design stuff.

I’m wondering if I should keep up with my monthly notes posts as over the last year they have contained mostly personal stuff, which I don’t mind sharing but I don’t know if those who read them also want more web design stuff.
