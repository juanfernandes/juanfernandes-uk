That's it - I have finally deleted my Gmail account. I've been using a self-hosted email address for a year now and slowly switching email addresses on websites I still use.

Whenever I got an email sent to my Gmail account in the last year - I would decide if I'm still using that website/service and decide if I want to keep my account. If I still use it, then I'd change the email address to my new one, otherwise, I just deleted the account.

So not only have I moved away from Gmail - I have also had a bit of a digital accounts cleanup.

This week I requested and downloaded all my 14,570 emails and today I deleted my account.

I have had that Gmail account since the Gmail beta days when it was invite-only.
