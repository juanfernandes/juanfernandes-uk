I love seeing what designers and developers use to do their job - so I thought I'd create my own /uses page.

These are the tools I like to use, it's ones I use when I can, but as a contractor I am used to adapting and using what ever tools the client needs me to use. So don't feel that just because I like a MacBook doesn't mean I can't use Windows. ðŸ˜Š

## Editor + Terminal
 - [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) is my editor of choice using the [Material Seti theme and colour scheme](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Material%20Theme) with whole bunch of add-ons and [custom settings](https://gist.github.com/juanfernandes/ba413678c7686f0c96b0 "GitHub gist with my custom sublime settings").
 - I'm using [iTerm 2](https://iterm2.com/) for my terminal - previously when using Ubuntu, I just used the default terminal. I tried Hyper but I didn't get on with it.
- I use [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) with the [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish) framework as my default shell on iTerm

## Desktop Apps

- For design I use [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) and [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) - Adobe Photoshop is far too expensive and I never used more than 10% of its features.
- I still have to use FTP for some clients, [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) has been my FTP client of choice for a long time.
- My main browser is Firefox - it has great developer tools, especially for CSS grid and has improved a lot over the years. I have Chromium, Safari and Brave for testing.
- For notes and writing, I use [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). It's cross-platform, which means all my notes are available on my phone, on the internet and my laptop.
- [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) for screencasts and recording training material for clients

## Desk Setup

- I currently use a 2018 15" MacBook Pro with 32gb of ram and maxed out processor 2.9 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i9
- My keyboard is a [Vinpok Taptek](https://www.vinpok.com/products/vinpok-taptek-thinnest-wireless-mac-mechanical-keyboard) mechanical keyboard which I backed on IndieGoGo but is now available for everyone
- My mouse is an MX Master 1 - its the most expensive mouse I have ever bought, but has been worth every penny
- My monitor is a 21" Samsung monitor - this is the next thing I will be replacing
- For sitting I use an [Autonomous Ergo Chair 2](https://www.autonomous.ai?rid=b98811)
- My desk is an Ikea [Skarsta](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s59324818/) sit / stand desk - I wish I had paid more and gone for the electronic version instead of the manual crank

## Other Gear

- OnePlus 5T android phone
- Blue Ice microphone
- Logitech HD Pro C920 webcam
- Old Logitech 5.1 speakers
- Generic mic stand (clamps to desk)
- Perinexx large desk matt
- Generic desk lamp

For testing responsive websites I build, I use the following mobiles and tablets:

- iPhone 4s
- iPhone 5s
- LG Nexus 4
- LG G3
- Google Pixel 3
- Kindle Fire 10
- iPad Mini

Not forgetting notepads, pens and pencils! I have probably forgotten many things, but I will update this if I have.
