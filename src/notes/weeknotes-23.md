As my current contract gets busier and we head towards a huge deadline, I'm a lot more tired in the evenings, so the last thing I want to do when I get to the hotel and get back on my computer and do some work or write a blog post.

Thinking about moving these to 'quarterlies' instead. Attempting to schedule writing these on the weekends to see if I can continue with the weeknotes, if not I'll try quarterlies as I may have more to write as well.

## Work
Busy last few weeks as I worked on the new header for H. Samuel, which was released last week.

I am now working from home 2 days a week, Mondays and Fridays which makes a huge difference to my well being and family life. Also, means less money spent on hotels and food while away.

Moved onto the next project - the redesign of the H. Samuel product page. The team has been working on the Ernest Jones version while I worked on the H. Samuel header.

My contract has been extended until the end of October now and will potentially extend to a few days a week in November which is great.


## Freelance
I've not had any freelance work to do for a while now, which makes sense, because I'm not actively looking for any and I have a 'full time' contract at the moment. But I have been chasing a customer since April to get them to complete a few tasks so that I can finish the project. I finished the development of the project back in April and it was sent over to them to test and complete the products list spreadsheet.

I'm not sure if I will be able to get another contract before the end of the year, with my current contract talking about having me back for a couple of days a week working remotely in November, I thought it might be a good idea to line up some freelance work for November and December that way I can finish the year working from home.


## Personal
Nothing much happening right now. Been prepping the house and garden ready for winter - boring things like making sure the gutters are clear and putting stuff away.

I haven't worked on my website since the new version went live - just been too busy at work - when I get back to the hotel I'm just too tired to get back on the computer.

I'm trying to get into the habit of posting tweets via my website, so that I own the content since my posts auto-post to twitter. The only thing I need to work out is how to get them to post to other networks now, like Mastodon.


## Reading
It's apparent that when I get busy at work, I don't read as much.
