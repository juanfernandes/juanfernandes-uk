I planned on doing lots of work on the new version of this website over the Christmas holidays, but then I bought loads of beers instead. Had a great Christmas and went to Nottingham for a hip hop concert.{.lead}

## Work
- The front end team is now the UX Design team, and we are now part of the product team. We had a product team get together in one of our London offices. It was great to meet my new boss, the head of UX, and also meet a load of people I've only met via Zoom.

## Personal
- On the 12th of December my girlfriend and I travelled to Nottingham to watch Ice Cube, Cypress Hill and The Game (he couldn't make it, Obie Trice was there instead) and what an amazing gig that was. Loved Ice Cube for so long, it was great to finally see him live. But Cypress Hill were f'ing amazing and they stole the show.

- This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 10-month anniversary - but being so close to Christmas we didn't do much for it.

- My first Christmas after divorce, and it was a much nicer one as the previous one was just after we split up, but the kids didn't know so we pretended everything was fine until the new year, which as you can imagine sucked.

- This was also the first Christmas spent with my girlfriend and her family. There were ten of us in total. Me, my three children and my mother-in-law, plus my girlfriend, her three children and her mum. I had never cooked for so many people and neither had my girlfriend, but it wasn't stressful at all, and we all had a great time.
