Not much to note for the month of June. Been busy with my permanent job and working to get the new Surbiton Tyre  and Wheel website finished.

## Work

* I've now been at my permanent job with [intelliflo](https://www.intelliflo.com/uk) for four months ðŸŽ‰ - which is a bit longer than my preferred contract length of 3 months.
* I've spent most of this month working on making a third-party in-app support tool look as if it's part of our application. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of `!important` use to override their CSS with ours. I'm don't like the idea of using a third-party tool but it's a complex and huge application - for us to do this internally would take a while. I even managed to get the interactive tooltips to inherit our customers custom themes!

## Freelance

* Continued working on the Surbiton Tyre and Wheel website -  mostly working on creating the templates to use with Forestry.io CMS and adding the content as well
* Been having a few issues with CSP + Webmentions but I think I have got them sorted out now

## Personal

* Been learning to skateboard with my daughter (11)
* I had my first covid jab ðŸ’‰ðŸŽ‰
* Been doing lots of work on the garden
