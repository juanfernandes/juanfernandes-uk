I'm way behind on these monthly blog posts that I've decided to forget about the last few months. There hasn't been much to write about these last few months, plus I've just been too busy with life and house stuff. Anyway, June was a good month; I'm glad the contractors have finished the loft conversion project - we now need to decorate and furnish. How was your month?

## Work
I've been working on a cool project which I can't say much about. But its one of those projects that really makes you use your brain! I'm using 11ty and TailwindCSS, although the project will be built using VueJS but that will be done by the developers in the team. There lots of tricky design elements that I am enjoying getting my teeth into. And best of all I don't need to do any JavaScript.

## Freelance
Finally finished and launched the [Arrival Lift Services](https://www.arrival-lifts.co.uk/ "Arrival Lift Services") website ðŸŽ‰. Really pleased with the design and also the performance. Built using 11ty and TailwindCSS and some vanilla JavaScript.

## Personal
The loft conversion project is finished... well almost, the contractors are done but we still need to decorate it. We decided to do that ourselves to reduce the cost a bit. We are really happy with most of it, there are a few things that we aren't happy with that cannot be changed right now - specifically the staircase going across the window. When we have more money we want to change the window for a different style and move it up. At the top of the stairs we're going to add a glass ballustrade so we can sit on a low sofa and enjoy the view of the green fileds in front. Due to new fire regulations all the bedrooms have had to have fire doors fitted, which are ok, but makes the place feel like a hotel.

Looking forward to making use of it once we've decorated it all!

The outside entertainment area which was also finished this year has now had the electrics done and two patio heaters installed. I now just need to finish building the kitchen area.
