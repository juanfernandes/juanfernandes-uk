<p class="lead">June was a really shit month. I lost my best friend. The relationship between my ex-wife went from amicable to hostile, which forced me to move out.</p>

## Personal

### The Bad
I‚Äôm not 100% sure what happened. I think has ex just snapped. It all started with her telling me that I needed to get rid of ‚Äúmy dog‚Äù, Kobe, because he had aggressively barked at a delivery person who entered our garden without ringing the bell. But also, he had been aggressively barking at my eldest daughter.

I was very upset, anyone would be, she didn't give me any time to try and fix the issue with my dog and my eldest child - the issue being she didn't like him and thus ignored him all the time and believe he just disowned her - my reaction was to just walk away, and I stopped speaking to her and everyone in the house for the next few days. She didn‚Äôt like this and that‚Äôs when things turned hostile.

Spent all my spare time trying to find a charity or someone that could re-home him, but every charity I spoke to were inundated with 'covid dogs' that they still don't have room for any more. My local RSPCA had a three-month wait just to be seen.

After a week I was accused of not doing anything about "getting rid of the dog", was accused of damaging her car and told that she felt threatened in her own home, and that she would not be returning until the dog was gone, oh and she also reported me to the police!

I didn't do anything to her car or make any kind of threats - the police never came to see me, but I do know she did report me as I was given the reference number. 

Then I was told he needed to go at the end of the week, or she would not be coming back home to look after the children - I had run out of time and options - no one would take him and I couldn't find anywhere to rent that would allow pets - not even Kennels had space.

I was left with only one choice, and it was one of the hardest choices I've ever had to make - Kobe was put to sleep.

I believe a lot of what happened is down to my ex-wife's boyfriend. He did not like Kobe and was scared of him. As soon as Kobe was gone, he and his dog moved into my house.

#### Moved out
After losing Kobe I never went back to my house, I just went to my girlfriend's house and I continued searching for a flat to rent. I did find a house (that needed a lot of work) but I loved it, but someone else beat me to getting an offer accepted.

I found a flat I liked after seeing a few, and I started the process and discovered that due to Brexit I now have to prove my right to rent in the UK, I knew about having to prove my right to work, just not renting too!

I moved into the flat on the 16th of June.

### The Good
I found out about one of those Axe and Knife throwing place that was only about an hour away from Suffolk and I took the kids for a day out, and we had so much fun - we will definitely be returning - checkout [UrbanXtreme](https://urbanxtreme.co.uk "UrbanXtreme") in Colchester.

Spent the rest of June moving stuff from my house into the flat, as well as having to buy so many things - from a bed to cutlery to washing machine and freezer. It was an expensive month, even though I only bought the essentials to start off with.

That's all for this month. I'm hoping in the future I will be writing about happier things happening in my life and maybe even get back to working on side projects and writing about code.

## üì∫ Watching
- [Black Mirror](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/42009-black-mirror "Black Mirror")
  Over the last ten years, technology has transformed almost every aspect of our lives before we've had time to stop and question it. In every home; on every desk; in every palm - a plasma screen; a monitor; a smartphone - a black mirror of our 21st Century existence.

- [Black Knight](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/137040 "Black Knight")
  In a dystopian 2071 devastated by air pollution, the survival of humanity depends on the Black Knights ‚Äî and they‚Äôre far from your average delivery men.

## üéß Listening
I didn't listen to many Mixcloud streams this month as I've been listening to more music on Spotify - feel free to checkout my [profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/juan.fernandes "Juan Fernandes' Spotify profile")
