## My main RSS Feed is now styled! ðŸŽ‰

I've seen a few websites that have a styled RSS feed page and liked this idea so I've just styled mine - [Blog RSS Feed](https://www.juanfernandes.uk/rss/feed.xml "Blog RSS Feed") - let me know what you think and if works alright for you. 

I've never used XSL before!
