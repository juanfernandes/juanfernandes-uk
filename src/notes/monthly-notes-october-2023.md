<p class="lead">October - lots more upheaval on a personal level - but we had Halloween and the kids really enjoyed it. Started working on a new design for this website.</p>

## Projects
- After migrating from Forestry.io over to [Tina CMS](https://tina.io/ "Tina CMS") managed to mess up the template I use for my streams - which are short posts that are auto shared to social media. Fixed this and a few minor buts too.

- I've decided that I need to redesign my website. So I've started by getting rid of the style sheet and started removed loads of code. I also started on a design, but I'm not feeling it any more - bored of it - just looks like every other website. I really want to let the creative juices flow and go wild with the design...

## Personal
- Due to broken relationships with my ex and her new partner, and a few heated arguments, my ex-wife said she had enough and dropped off the younger two children with me at my 2-bed flat!

- Been with my girlfriend for 8 months now, and she still hasn't got fed up with me - I must be doing something right.

- Had 2 viewings of the house - it only took 9 months - one didn't provide any feedback and the other had not even put their own house on the market! It's still for sale.

- First time getting a haircut with my son at the same time - nice bit of father son bonding.
