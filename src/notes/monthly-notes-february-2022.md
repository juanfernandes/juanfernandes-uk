Very short update for this month. Mostly personal updates, a lot of articles read and some freelance work. (Took me a while to get this posted.)

## Freelance
- Continued work on the redesign and rebuild of the [Arrival Lift Services](https://www.arrival-lifts.co.uk "Arrival Lift Services") website
- Posted my [January Monthly notes](/notes/monthly-notes-january-2022/ "Monthly Notes: January 2022")
- Removed Forestry.io CMS from my website - I ran into an issue I couldn't resolve and support didn't get back to me. I only had a CMS to learn and test features for when using it with client websites

## Personal
- We got a new family pet - a 4 month old Doberman that we named Kobe - now our children are older it took a lot longer to choose a name everyone liked
- After a lot of research we decided to get a Traeger BBQ and Smoker - its a pellet wood one and its a new concept for us, but we figure it would be cheaper to run, plus easy for both of us to use
- Got round to setting up the fairy lights we bought in last years Amazon Prime Day sales in our outside entertainment area
