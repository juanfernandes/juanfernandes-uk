Busy month adjusting to being a permanent employee again and finishing off freelance work. New de-googled Android mobile phone.

## Freelance
- Got a new web design client - Gratuu.com have asked me to design and build them a brand new website

- Added an update to a clients' podcast website to show episodes automatically when they publish them on Anchor.fm

- Continued building the new Surbiton Tyres & Wheel website - all components have now been coded and styled, pages have been created. Waiting for the client to provide the content now

- Started creating my own Eleventy + TailwindCSS website starter for building out websites quickly for clients with smaller budgets

## Personal
- I bought a new mobile phone. A [Fairphone 3+](https://shop.fairphone.com/gb_en/fairphone-3-plus) running a de-googled version of Android called [/e/ OS](https://e.foundation/) - I'm planning on writing a review about the experience of switching to a de-googled phone properly and also using a Fairphone.
