<p class="lead">Developing an ecommerce site for my daughter's clothing brand. I recently saw The Roots, De La Soul and The Pharcyde at Dreamland Margate, which was great. Unfortunately, an elderly driver hit my car in a Tesco car park. The house had two viewings, but no bids at auction.</p>

## Projects
- I've been working on an ecommerce website for my daughter's clothing brand. Still early stages. I decided to use [YourNextStore](https://yournextstore.com/) to get me started with a Next.js and Stripe solution. It's a bit limited compared to using something like Snipcart, but it's enough for this project.

## Personal
- Went to see three of my favourite hip-hop groups, The Roots, De La Soul and The Pharcyde at Dreamland Margate - was a great event.
- Unfortunately, an elderly person drove into my car whilst I was queuing to leave a Tesco car park I tried to swerve out of the way but had too many cars coming towards me. She dented the rear passenger side door and a pillar. No one was hurt.
- House Update: 2 viewings, auction ended with no bids
