## Added mastodon-post Web Component
Since I'm no longer using Twitter all that much and pretty much spend all my time on Mastodon, my blog posts don't get many web mentions. When I saw that [David Darnes](https://mastodon.design/@daviddarnes) created a [`mastodon-post` web component](https://darn.es/mastodon-post-web-component/) - I thought this was a perfect time to get into web components!

I also read Cory's post on how they implemented the same component onto their 11ty website - but their method is far too smart for my brain!
