## Changelog: Added featured authors section
I was hoping to create some kind of filter that would show all the links by a particular author, but haven't quite figured it out yet. Instead, I have a Featured Authors section which links to the authors whose articles I've linked to in the current page.

Check out the [links](/links/) page.
