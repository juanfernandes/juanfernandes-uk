<p class="lead">Celebrated my one-year anniversary with my girlfriend, my eldest visiting sixth form college, and the house was relisted for sale with new estate agents.</p>

## Personal
- My girlfriend and I celebrated our 1-year anniversary by going out to our favourite restaurant
- My eldest will be continuing her education in sixth form, and we went for her interview at her preferred sixth form college
- The house has been relisted for sale again, this time with two new estate agents. We've also appointed a property expert company to help us sell it
