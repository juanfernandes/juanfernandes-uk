<p class="lead">May did not end on a happy note, unfortunately. Iâ€™m now technically homeless, and I no longer have my dog.</p>

## Work
- Got to do some freelance work for one of my existing clients. They needed me to do some updates to their WordPress website. I did not build this website - it looks great visually, but working with it and WP was a nightmare

- Nothing different at work, still a very slow pace. The change over to working with the SAFe methodology is going very slowly - still loads of meetings about work. Best thing about it is that I'm just doing design work and don't even have Docker installed

## Personal
- Went on a mountain bike ride with my mate matt, his son and my son on an actual mountain bike trail in Tunstall forest

- Told my daughter about how much fun the bike ride was that she wanted to - off I went on another ride with my daughter Tasha the following weekend

- I'm not a football fan, haven't been since I was a teenager. I don't hate football, I do watch some of the World Cup games. But I got to go to the Women's FA Cup final with my daughter and what a match for my first ever time being at a football game in a stadium

- This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 3-month anniversary and I surprised her with tickets to see Red Hot Chilli Peppers - her favourite band whom she has never been to see live

    <summary>Content Warning: pet death</summary>
    <p>Things at home went from amicable to hostile very quickly during the last week of May. Our second dog has been aggressively barking at our eldest daughter, and my ex-wife (whom I shared a house with since the separation) told me that my dog needed to go.</p>
    <p>I spent all week trying to find a charity that would take him in for rehoming. I was very upset - he was there for me when my ex decided to end our marriage. So I stopped talking to her. She didn't like this and went off on a mission to make my life a living hell.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately on Saturday the 4th of June my beautiful boy was put to sleep - my ex sent me a text on that Saturday morning that time was up, and he needed to go now. ðŸ˜­</p>
