## Changelog: Added links page
I've been sharing links to articles I read to social media for a while now - this happens soon after I've read it - I aim to read at least 2 articles a day. Recently I noticed that a lot of people have created a links page to store links they've shared - so it made sense for me to do that as well - it's a great way to archive and be able to revisit when I'm looking for something I've shared.

I already had a links page though - which was a collection of all the places you can find me online, this was renamed to [social-links](/social-links) instead!

Check out my [links](/links) page.
