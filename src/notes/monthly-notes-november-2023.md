<p class="lead">Lots of personal stuff happened this month and this meant I've not had any time to work on any side projects and nothing worth mentioning has happened at work, so it's a short monthly note.</p>

## Personal
- I've been wanting to get a pick-up truck for a long time now, and since I live in the countryside which floods a lot, plus we get snow drifts - it makes sense to own one, and I finally got a Ford Ranger Limited. I traded the family car - a Ford Edge - which was chosen by the ex-wife, so I didn't want it in my life any more.

- Due to the hostile situation caused by my ex-wife and her partner, which led her to send all three children to live with me, in my small 2-bed flat - at this point I had to involve solicitors and as a result my ex and her partner were told to move out of the family home and the children and I moved back into family home.

- For some unknown reason my eldest was convinced to in with my ex and her partner, which I wouldn't normally have an issue but the fact she was persuaded to runaway from my flat at 2am on a Saturday night by jump out a first floor window and get collected by my ex and her partner without my knowledge - that was not OK.

- On a much happier note - my girlfriend and I have now been together for 9 months ‚ù§Ô∏è

- Oh yeah, and I turned 42! No, its not [the answer to everything](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer)).  I got loads of presents, but my favourite was The Office Lego set my girlfriend got me.
