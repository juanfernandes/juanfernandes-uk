## My website now has web mentions ðŸŽ‰

For those who don't know what web mentions are; its a way to show social media comments and interactions on your website. If I post a blog post to twitter and someone comments or likes that tweet, that will be added to the blog post.

### Example

[Working an inside IR35 contract](https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/working-an-inside-ir35-contract/ "Working an inside IR35 contract")

### Sources

Thanks to [Sia Karamalegos](https://twitter.com/TheGreenGreek), [AngÃ©lique Weger](https://twitter.com/messypixels) and [Max BÃ¶ck](https://twitter.com/mxbck) for their blog posts and their code, because without it I wouldn't have managed to add this to my website.
