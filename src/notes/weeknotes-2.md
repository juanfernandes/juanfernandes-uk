This week I'm starting with what didn't go well, as it was a bit of a blow for me. I'm also introducing a personal section because I like writing about my personal life on my blog, so felt it was appropriate - it also explains why I didn't get much work done on my website!

## What didn't go well

### Work
Last week this was in the 'what went well' section because I'd gotten a new contract, fully remote and working for an agency, which is something that I've been wanting for a while. 

But it wasn't meant to be. 

### Reading
I read a few articles - but I want to read at least 2 a day and I didn't manage read any more of Eloquent JavaScript or Stephen Kings The Dark Tower - I'm on book number five. 

### This website
Once again I didn't get any spare time to work on my website. As I mentioned before I converting it from PHP to using a static site generator. I did manage to create a whole bunch of issues on my gitlab repo - this means I will be able to work an issue at a time, rather than looking at "Personal Website" on my to-do list.


## What went well

### Work
Towards the end of the week, I secured a new contract (yay!) - this is due to start on the 25th. I'll be working with Hoseasons. Very excited to get back to work, looking forward to new challenges and working with a new team.

### Learning JavaScript
This week I started a new course - Introduction to JavaScript by CodeAcademy. It started off with a lot of basic stuff I already knew and I thought it may have been too basic, but I soon started learning new things. I also have a bit of a learning roadmap put together, so I know what I need to learn next.


## Personal
I've spent a lot of time this week not doing web design things, but instead I've been doing some DIY. Next week we are having new carpet fitted in the whole of the upstairs and we decided that we didn't like the skirting boards being so dark (dark mahogany) and decided to paint them white. This took a while as I had to do 2 coats of undercoat and then 2 coats of the white paint.

Also, my son managed to break his bedroom door through slamming it open (and shut) too many times! The wood frame where the hinge is attached cracked and I wasn't able to repair the crack. So I ended up removing a lot of the decorative part of the frame, then cut the main part of the door frame in half and replace it with a new piece of wood and now its all back. Just needs a few coats of paint now thatI've filled and sanded the nail holes.
