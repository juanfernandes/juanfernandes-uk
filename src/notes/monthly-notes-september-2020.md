September flew by. Not much to report as it was a quiet month on the work and personal fronts. Launched a new client website and a got personal achievement too.{.lead}

## Work
- Still no luck on the job front, I'm now considering going back to permanent work
- Finished the martial arts website I've been working on - check it out - [Kuk Sool Won of Woodbridge](https://www.kuksoolwonwoodbridge.co.uk) - built using HTML CSS/Sass, Nunjucks and Eleventy, hosted on Netlify
- I sent a proposal for a new client website - waiting to hear back on whether it is going ahead
- Two potential leads, one I need to prepare a proposal for

## Personal
- ðŸŽ‰ I completed the Couch to 5k program - YAY
- Tried to continue running (Mon, Wed & Fri) and then do a HiiT in between runs, but my body still dislikes the intensity of a HiiT.
- Now the weather is colder and wet, I'm struggling with getting out for a run
