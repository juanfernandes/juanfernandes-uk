Yes this is very late. Sorry. July was a bit of a slow month work-wise, both freelance and permanent - although I'm not actively looking for new freelance work.

## Personal
* Our loft conversion project has finally been completed - apart from the decorating which we are doing ourselves
* Did a bit more work on our outside kitchen - still got lots left to get it finished - but been holding off as everything is really expensive especially wood
* First stage of the network cabling and setup for the converted loft space has been done. I got a new network cabinet switch installed in the loft - in the non-converted side
