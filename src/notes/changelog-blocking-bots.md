## Changelog: Blocking GoogleBot and ChatGPT bot

With the rise of AI and companies profiting from free content online, I, like many others, have decided to just block access to those bots. I will add to my robots.txt file as I find more bots to block. 

I don't care about being 'found' on search engines these days, as I don't need it to get freelance work because I rarely do freelance work these days anyway.
