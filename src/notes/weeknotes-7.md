Well, it was another uneventful and unproductive week - I've been distracted all week.

## Decisions
I've decided to finish my current contract early. I've never done this and I have mixed feelings about it, but I know that I am not happy here and I don't see it getting better. 

I had brief chat with the web development manager - I wasn't prepared for it, he just popped over to my desk and said can we have a chat. If I had been prepared I may have been more open about how I was feeling, I did explain how it's been difficult to get any work done because of how the DEV and QA environments are set up. He was understanding about it and knows its a problem, but it's not an overnight fix. He also said that the project I was supposed to be on was likely to be put on hold.

That told me that it was time to move on. All I've been doing there, when I've had work to do, is bug fixing. Bug fixing is hard, its even harder when you don't know the systems or anything ever works, or that the fixes your trying to fix, have had two previous developers work on it and nobody knows what they did. But also it's not the type of work I became a contractor/freelancer for - that's what I was doing when I was a permanent employee.

If all goes to plan, I'll be finishing my current contract on Friday and then I'm off to start a new contract the following week in Manchester. It's a month-long contract working as an Interaction Designer on a government project. More info next week.

I've wanted to get back into an interaction designer role for a while now and have also been trying to work in government as well. I'm hoping this contract, though short, will be the stepping stone into more work in government.

### Until next week
So this week note is shorter than usual, but that ok, my mind has been busy thinking about the future and what sort of work I want to do and don't even mention politics! What a week. Great to see so many people sign the #RevokeArticle50 petition - let's hope it makes a difference. 

Until next week - have a great one.
