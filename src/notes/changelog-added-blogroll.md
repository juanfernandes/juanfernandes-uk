## Changelog: Added a Blogroll

I decided to be like the cool kids in the web design industry and added a blogroll - a list of the web design blogs that I follow.

I was originally going to folllow Ben's Eleventy Blogroll tutorial but it didn't work for me - I put it down to some of the dependencies not being the same version, but other stuff broke when I changed versions.

So I manually created a JSON file with all the links, links to favicons and links to RSS feeds.

Check out my [blogroll](/blogroll/ "Blogroll")
