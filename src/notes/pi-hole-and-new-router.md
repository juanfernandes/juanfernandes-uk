The next stage in my privacy control adventure is to setup Pi-hole at home. To do this I've had to buy a new router to replace the BT Home Hub because it doesn't let you change the DNS servers, which you need to do in order to point it at Pi-hole.

New router has now been setup and the BT Home Hub is being used just for WIFI.

Will be setting up the Pi-hole this weekend.
