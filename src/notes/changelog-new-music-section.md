## Changelog: New Music Section

**Update**: Fixed the link to the music page

I’ve added a new ~~Music~~ **Listening** section to the site.

It pulls directly from my [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/juanfernandes) data and shows what I’ve been listening to each week — including top tracks, albums and artists. The landing page gives a snapshot of the current rotation, while individual pages let you browse the full lists (now paginated).

I’ve also added a stats page that tracks both this week’s listening and my all-time unique artists, albums and tracks. It’s updated automatically, so the numbers should stay current without any manual updates.

This is something I’ve wanted to build for a while — part curiosity, part accountability, part excuse to over-engineer something that didn’t need over-engineering.

More improvements to come.

Check out my [Listening](/logs/listening/ "Listening") page.
