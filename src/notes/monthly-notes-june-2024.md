## üì∫ Watching

### TV
**[Money Heist](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/71446-la-casa-de-papel "Money Heist")**  
To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called The Professor recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion - memorizing every step, every detail, every probability - culminate in eleven days locked up in the National Coinage and Stamp Factory of Spain, surrounded by police forces and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.

### Films
**[Talk to Me](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/1008042-talk-to-me)** ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  
When a group of friends discover how to conjure spirits using an embalmed hand, they become hooked on the new thrill, until one of them goes too far and unleashes terrifying supernatural forces.
