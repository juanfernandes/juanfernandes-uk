"Google recently announced the rollout of their Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), a new advertising-surveillance initiative that seeks to replace third-party cookies with a new user profiling technique that garners data generated by the browser itself."

Yeah - no thanks Google. Following Paramdeo's instructions I have added `Permissions-Policy = "interest-cohort=()"` to my `netlify.toml` file and just like that my website will be opted out of the Google FLoC network.

Follow the instructions in  Paramdeo's post if you want to do the same to your website - [Opting your Website out of Google's FLoC Network](https://paramdeo.com//blog/opting-your-website-out-of-googles-floc-network "Opting your Website out of Google's FLoC Network")
