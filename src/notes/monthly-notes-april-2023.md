<p class="lead">Been feeling a lot better about my personal situation, celebrated a 2-month anniversary with my girlfriend. Went bowling with my children, and my eldest celebrated turning fifteen.</p>

## Work
Nothing much happening at work, and I've had enough, so it's time to move on. I handed in my notice and have to work a three-month notice period. I'll be sad to leave my team, but I'm no good to anyone if I'm not motivated at work.

## Personal
- Whilst driving back from London and having several diversions due to roadworks, I hit a massive pothole so ended up having to change my wheel on the side of a busy road at 2am! Luckily, as it turned out, I didn't new a new alloy, just a new tyre.

- Kobe, my Dobermann was castrated, and I also got them to remove his rear (dangly) dewclaws

- Celebrated a 2-month anniversary with my girlfriend by going for a steak at Miller and Carter

- Decided I needed to do more with my children, so we went bowling and had a lot of fun

- My eldest child turned 15 - I feel ancient! And to celebrate, I took her to the cinema to watch [Evil Dead Rise](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead_rise "Evil Dead Rise")
