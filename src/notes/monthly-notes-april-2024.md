<p class="lead">Oof, what a month. Huge improvement in lots of aspects. The house still has not sold or even had any interest - it seems we'll have no choice but opt for a cash buy out. Lots of changes at work and did some updates on my website.</p>

## Work
Still a lot of change in processes going on at work, as well as transitioning to being a UX designer instead of a Front-end Developer. At the same time, trying to educate the different teams on the role UX needs to play in the work being produced.

## Projects
- Added an RSS Feed for my Links page - this is where I published all the links to articles I've read. Now people can subscribe to the RSS feed instead of having to revisit the page
- Added pagination to the [links](/links/) and [blog](/blog/) pages. The links page was starting to get a bit long as I share a lot of articles. The pagination for the blog shows page numbers, as there won't be loads of posts - not for a while. On the links page, the pagination does not include page numbers, just navigation links
- I also added a [colophon](/colophon/) to mention some of the technology I use on this website, as well a place to show my Changelog notes and a GIT commit history

## Personal
- My girlfriend and I, along with her 2 boys and my son, went crabbing at Walberswick. It was a very nice day out. The boys caught lots of crabs, and we all enjoyed an ice cream
- Bought tickets for [The Roots, De La Soul and The Pharcyde at Dreamland in Margate](https://www.dreamland.co.uk/event/the-roots/)! I can't wait to see three of my favourite Hip Hop groups
- Eldest turned 16! Yes, I do feel quite old now. I bought her a brand-new pair of Nike Air Forces and paid for her to have her dyed
