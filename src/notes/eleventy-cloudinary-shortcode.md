I made a thing. I've created a shortcode for [@eleventy](https://fosstodon.org/@eleventy "Eleventy") so I can use Cloudinary images within markdown files. This is something I discovered I needed while using Forestry.io and markdown files.{.lead}

With a bit of help from [@FrankTldr](https://mobile.twitter.com/FrankTldr "Frank Taillandier") at Forestry in identifying the solution, I set off and created it.
