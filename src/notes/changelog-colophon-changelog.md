## Changelog: Added a Changelog page

I previously created a colophon page for this website that also showed my changelog notes and git commits, but since I saw the Slash Pages website, I realised its common to have there two as separate pages.

Check out my [Changelog](/changelog/ "Changelog") and [Colophon](/colophon/ "Colophon") pages.
