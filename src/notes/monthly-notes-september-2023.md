<p class="lead">Not a busy month, but wish it was less stressful. Managed to work on my personal website, which was a good a distraction.</p>

## Projects
- Finally got round to removing Forestry CMS and replacing it with Tina CMS - Forestry was discontinued, so I had to remove it and found that Tina CMS was the perfect replacement - also it's made by the same people.

## Personal
- My eldest daughter is now living with me - due to issues with my ex and her partner, my daughter didn't feel comfortable staying there any more.

- So since my daughter is now living with me, I've had to shuffle things around the flat - I was using the small, second bedroom as my work office but that how's now become my daughter's bedroom - this also meant a trip to Ikea to get her all new furniture because I'm not allowed anywhere near my house.

- My mate has got me into playing squash. It's the first time I've ever played it, and it was a lot better than I expected - it's great fun and a very good workout.
