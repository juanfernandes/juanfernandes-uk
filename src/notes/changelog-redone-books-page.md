## Changelog: Redone books page
I've changed my books page to now include books I want to read, currently it's books I already own, and it's just the Stephen King ones. But I plan on adding all my other books. I isolated the book I'm currently reading as well. I changed the JSON file structure to better suit this new page format.

Check out my [Books](/books/ "Books") page.
