Saw a tweet about how websites with RSS should have a link to it in the header to save digging into code to find it and I also hate that, but I also didn't have any links to my RSS feed.

Well I had a task to add these other links to my site and was going to wait until the redesign, but decided to redesign the footer slightly to include them.
