**Not a very busy month as the year comes to an end and things slow down ready for the Christmas break. Spent quite a bit of time working on improving my website by forcing myself to adhere to my strict Content Security Policies.**

## Work

* Finished building the homepage template for my clients' website redesign. This is my first project using TailwindCSS. Its been a great learning experience but I'm still not convinced TailwindCSS will replace Sass for me
* Continued with my new contract at Defra as an interaction designer setting up a repository for components and page layouts used within internal systems

## Personal

* After applying quite a strict set of Content Security Policies to my website a few weeks ago and breaking images, inline CSS and JS - I spent a few hours making changes to my website to fix those issues and better comply with my CSP rules - blog post coming soon
* Finally got round to changing my master branch on my websites repo to main - see this [post by Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main)
