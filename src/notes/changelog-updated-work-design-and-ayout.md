## Changelog: Updated Work design and layout

Finally got round to redesigning and rebuilding my Work case study pages. I've not been adding previous works as I didn't like the old design/layout, but now I'm happy with it, I'm going to add all my more recent works.

Check out my updated [Work](/work/ "Work") page and [new work case study](/work/property-with-potential/) I added using the new design.
