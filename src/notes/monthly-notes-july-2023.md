July has been a much better month. It's been a month since I moved out of my home and started living in a rented flat. Got to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers live in London.{.lead}

## Work
- There is a lot of behind the scenes changes happening at work, all for the best, including moving to a SAFe (which is an agile framework) - that's the boring bit though, but this does mean we are slowly starting to do design work FIRST, rather than after changes have gone live! As part of this I've had a job title change to UI/UX Designer (was UI Frontend Developer) and on a sad note, our team has been split and put into different agile teams, but we are now all part of the Product team instead of development.

- Went into the company office in Wimbledon - second time in almost three years - but unfortunately it was to say goodbye to a colleague who's leaving for a 2-year round the world trip on her motorbike - which everyone is very jealous off - including me!

## Personal
Have been spending too much money, but it's all stuff I needed for the flat.  I've now been in my rented flat for over a month!

- Got a dining table which also happens to be a pool and table tennis table! Bargain 3 in 1, and we have yet to use it as a dining table and I still need to get seating for it - the plan is to get two benches.

- Got a freezer (small counter top one) and washing machine - both of which are in the tiny utility room (no room in the kitchen for the freezer) - but at least I didn't need to buy a fridge as one came with the flat.

- My girlfriend and I went to London to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers play live at the Tottenham Hotspurs stadium - it was an amazing gig and some great supporting acts including The Roots!

- Celebrated our five-month anniversary by taking my girlfriend out for a steak meal at our favourite restaurant - Miller & Carter.

I've kept this post and my previous one on the short side, as I'm quite behind on posting these. Hopefully now the dust has started to settle with my personal stuff, I should be able to focus on more tech stuff too.

## ðŸ“º Watching
- [Black Knight](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/137040 "Black Knight")
  In a dystopian 2071 devastated by air pollution, the survival of humanity depends on the Black Knights â€” and theyâ€™re far from your average delivery men.

I didn't listen to many Mixcloud streams this month as I've been listening to more music on Spotify - feel free to checkout my [profile](https://open.spotify.com/user/juan.fernandes "Juan Fernandes' Spotify profile")
