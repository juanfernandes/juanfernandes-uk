<p class="lead">August was a VERY expensive month for me - what with getting the car back and getting it back on the road (MOT, tax & insurance) as well as paying for a mortgage advisor and mortgage.</p>

## Projects
- With AI being a hot topic at the moment, a few posts popped up on my social feeds talking about how AI bots have had free rein to learn from anyone's content on the internet without any form of attribution to original content creators. So I blocked AI bots on my website as well as the Googlebot because well I don't like them and their search engine is now rubbish

## Personal
- I tried to buy a house, my offer was accepted, and I even got a mortgage offer - but turns out you can't buy a house when you still own another house (one that I can't live in)

- Celebrated mine and my girlfriends' 6th month anniversary

- Went to Aldeburgh Carnival as my girlfriend's son was on one of the floats - this was also the first time my son met her youngest son, and they got on really well

- Went Pleasurewood Hills with my girlfriend, her children and my children - this was the first time everyone met each other. We all had a great time

- Finally, got my car back after months of it being at the body shop for repair after the accident where someone drove into the side of my car, they've been waiting for months for a part - which I assume had to come from Canada since that's where my car was made, and they no longer sell them in the UK

- Since I didn't have my car for a while, I declared it SORN'd as it was off-road. But the MOT ran out, then the insurance - so all together I had to get an MOT, tax and insure it. Plus the insurance excess - it was a very expensive month

- And to top off the expensive month, my coffee machine broke - so I sent it off for repair!
