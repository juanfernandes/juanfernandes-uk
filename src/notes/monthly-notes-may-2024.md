<p class="lead">Pretty uneventful month, which is never a bad thing. Spent some time adding more content to my website and did quite a bit of dev work on it too. Went into the work office and also went to the UEFA Women's Cup Final.</p>

## Work
- Popped into the intelliflo office in Wimbledon for a day of UX team meetings

## Projects
- Decided to move the [changelog](/changelog/) away from the [colophon](/colophon/) page and into its own page.
- Redesigned the [books](/books/) page to separate books into sections - read, currently reading and want to read.
- I wanted to highlight Authors of the articles I share on my [links](/links/) page - so now every page will show authors whose articles are on that page.
- Caught up on writing my [Monthly Notes](/tags/monthly-notes/) posts.
- Added tag cloud to blog page to allow users to filter posts by tag.

## Personal
- I got my second tattoo done. It's a bit of a tribute to my favourite author, Stephen King - it's a crow standing on a skull.
- My daughter and I attended the UEFA Women's cup final - as always it was a great game - women's football is much better than men's!
