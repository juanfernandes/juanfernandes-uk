<p class="lead">I only realised March was over about one week into April so that's why this post is so late.</p>

## Personal
- Bought an Apple Watch (the SE model) as My Garmin watch stopped working. Quite enjoying the way it works with my iPhone and MacBook Pro
- Since I got a PS5 at the beginning of the year I'd not used it much so I decided to get a PSP+ subscription and started playing some included classic games like [Tekken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken "Tekken") and [Ridge Racer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_Racer "Ridge Racer") but also started playing [Stray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_(video_game) "Stray")
- My girlfriend has met my dog and two of my children - and they all approved of her üòÅ
- Went to an Ipswich Theatre for a talk called - Psychology of Serial Killers with my girlfriend and my eldest daughter, we're all into this stuff üòÅ
