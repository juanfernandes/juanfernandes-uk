<p class="lead">Pretty slow start to the year - which is a good thing considering the year I've just had. Trying to get on with my new life but still one big tie to my ex which is the house.</p>

## Work
- The Head of UX has started at my company and they are my new boss. I was going to say the 'new' head of UX, but we've never had one. It's great that the company is finally wanting to change and start thinking about the user first.

- This means I'm now known as a UI/UX Designer and my team is now known as the UX Team. So many things to learn and also change how the business has done it in the past.

## Personal
- This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 11-month anniversary ðŸ’œ

- I finally got my first tattoo. Itâ€™s taken me a while to finally get one, and itâ€™s one that is a bit of an inside joke with my girlfriend - she got one herself to match.

- My ex has been sacked and now isnâ€™t going to start paying child maintenance and also cannot continue paying her half of the mortgage

- House has still not sold. Weâ€™re now exploring a different approach to selling the house.
