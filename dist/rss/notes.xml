      <h2>Added mastodon-post Web Component</h2>
<p>Since I'm no longer using Twitter all that much and pretty much spend all my time on Mastodon, my blog posts don't get many web mentions. When I saw that <a href="https://mastodon.design/@daviddarnes">David Darnes</a> created a <a href="https://darn.es/mastodon-post-web-component/"><code>mastodon-post</code> web component</a> - I thought this was a perfect time to get into web components!</p>
<p>I also read Cory's post on how they implemented the same component onto their 11ty website - but their method is far too smart for my brain!</p>

      <h2>Changelog: Added links page</h2>
<p>I've been sharing links to articles I read to social media for a while now - this happens soon after I've read it - I aim to read at least 2 articles a day. Recently I noticed that a lot of people have created a links page to store links they've shared - so it made sense for me to do that as well - it's a great way to archive and be able to revisit when I'm looking for something I've shared.</p>
<p>I already had a links page though - which was a collection of all the places you can find me online, this was renamed to <a href="/social-links">social-links</a> instead!</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="/links">links</a> page.</p>

      <p class="lead">Pretty slow start to the year - which is a good thing considering the year I've just had. Trying to get on with my new life but still one big tie to my ex which is the house.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Head of UX has started at my company and they are my new boss. I was going to say the 'new' head of UX, but we've never had one. It's great that the company is finally wanting to change and start thinking about the user first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This means I'm now known as a UI/UX Designer and my team is now known as the UX Team. So many things to learn and also change how the business has done it in the past.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 11-month anniversary 💜</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I finally got my first tattoo. It’s taken me a while to finally get one, and it’s one that is a bit of an inside joke with my girlfriend - she got one herself to match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My ex has been sacked and now isn’t going to start paying child maintenance and also cannot continue paying her half of the mortgage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>House has still not sold. We’re now exploring a different approach to selling the house.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="lead">I planned on doing lots of work on the new version of this website over the Christmas holidays, but then I bought loads of beers instead. Had a great Christmas and went to Nottingham for a hip hop concert.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>The front end team is now the UX Design team, and we are now part of the product team. We had a product team get together in one of our London offices. It was great to meet my new boss, the head of UX, and also meet a load of people I've only met via Zoom.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the 12th of December my girlfriend and I travelled to Nottingham to watch Ice Cube, Cypress Hill and The Game (he couldn't make it, Obie Trice was there instead) and what an amazing gig that was. Loved Ice Cube for so long, it was great to finally see him live. But Cypress Hill were f'ing amazing and they stole the show.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 10-month anniversary - but being so close to Christmas we didn't do much for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My first Christmas after divorce, and it was a much nicer one as the previous one was just after we split up, but the kids didn't know so we pretended everything was fine until the new year, which as you can imagine sucked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This was also the first Christmas spent with my girlfriend and her family. There were ten of us in total. Me, my three children and my mother-in-law, plus my girlfriend, her three children and her mum. I had never cooked for so many people and neither had my girlfriend, but it wasn't stressful at all, and we all had a great time.</p>
</li>

      <p class="lead">Lots of personal stuff happened this month and this meant I've not had any time to work on any side projects and nothing worth mentioning has happened at work, so it's a short monthly note.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've been wanting to get a pick-up truck for a long time now, and since I live in the countryside which floods a lot, plus we get snow drifts - it makes sense to own one, and I finally got a Ford Ranger Limited. I traded the family car - a Ford Edge - which was chosen by the ex-wife, so I didn't want it in my life any more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Due to the hostile situation caused by my ex-wife and her partner, which led her to send all three children to live with me, in my small 2-bed flat - at this point I had to involve solicitors and as a result my ex and her partner were told to move out of the family home and the children and I moved back into family home.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some unknown reason my eldest was convinced to in with my ex and her partner, which I wouldn't normally have an issue but the fact she was persuaded to runaway from my flat at 2am on a Saturday night by jump out a first floor window and get collected by my ex and her partner without my knowledge - that was not OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On a much happier note - my girlfriend and I have now been together for 9 months ❤️</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Oh yeah, and I turned 42! No, its not <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(answer)">the answer to everything</a>.  I got loads of presents, but my favourite was The Office Lego set my girlfriend got me.</p>

      <p class="lead">October - lots more upheaval on a personal level - but we had Halloween and the kids really enjoyed it. Started working on a new design for this website.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After migrating from Forestry.io over to <a href="https://tina.io/" title="Tina CMS">Tina CMS</a> managed to mess up the template I use for my streams - which are short posts that are auto shared to social media. Fixed this and a few minor buts too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've decided that I need to redesign my website. So I've started by getting rid of the style sheet and started removed loads of code. I also started on a design, but I'm not feeling it any more - bored of it - just looks like every other website. I really want to let the creative juices flow and go wild with the design...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Due to broken relationships with my ex and her new partner, and a few heated arguments, my ex-wife said she had enough and dropped off the younger two children with me at my 2-bed flat!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Been with my girlfriend for 8 months now, and she still hasn't got fed up with me - I must be doing something right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had 2 viewings of the house - it only took 9 months - one didn't provide any feedback and the other had not even put their own house on the market! It's still for sale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First time getting a haircut with my son at the same time - nice bit of father son bonding.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="lead">Not a busy month, but wish it was less stressful. Managed to work on my personal website, which was a good a distraction.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finally got round to removing Forestry CMS and replacing it with Tina CMS - Forestry was discontinued, so I had to remove it and found that Tina CMS was the perfect replacement - also it's made by the same people.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My eldest daughter is now living with me - due to issues with my ex and her partner, my daughter didn't feel comfortable staying there any more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So since my daughter is now living with me, I've had to shuffle things around the flat - I was using the small, second bedroom as my work office but that how's now become my daughter's bedroom - this also meant a trip to Ikea to get her all new furniture because I'm not allowed anywhere near my house.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My mate has got me into playing squash. It's the first time I've ever played it, and it was a lot better than I expected - it's great fun and a very good workout.</p>
</li>

      <p class="lead">August was a VERY expensive month for me - what with getting the car back and getting it back on the road (MOT, tax & insurance) as well as paying for a mortgage advisor and mortgage.</p>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>With AI being a hot topic at the moment, a few posts popped up on my social feeds talking about how AI bots have had free rein to learn from anyone's content on the internet without any form of attribution to original content creators. So I blocked AI bots on my website as well as the Googlebot because well I don't like them and their search engine is now rubbish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried to buy a house, my offer was accepted, and I even got a mortgage offer - but turns out you can't buy a house when you still own another house (one that I can't live in)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrated mine and my girlfriends' 6th month anniversary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Went to Aldeburgh Carnival as my girlfriend's son was on one of the floats - this was also the first time my son met her youngest son, and they got on really well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Went Pleasurewood Hills with my girlfriend, her children and my children - this was the first time everyone met each other. We all had a great time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, got my car back after months of it being at the body shop for repair after the accident where someone drove into the side of my car, they've been waiting for months for a part - which I assume had to come from Canada since that's where my car was made, and they no longer sell them in the UK</p>

<p>Since I didn't have my car for a while, I declared it SORN'd as it was off-road. But the MOT ran out, then the insurance - so all together I had to get an MOT, tax and insure it. Plus the insurance excess - it was a very expensive month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And to top off the expensive month, my coffee machine broke - so I sent it off for repair!</p>

      <h2>Changelog: Added a Blogroll</h2>
<p>I decided to be like the cool kids in the web design industry and added a blogroll - a list of the web design blogs that I follow.</p>
<p>I was originally going to follow Ben's Eleventy Blogroll tutorial, but it didn't work for me - I put it down to some of the dependencies not being the same version, but other stuff broke when I changed versions.</p>
<p>So I manually created a JSON file with all the links, links to favicons and links to RSS feeds.</p>
<p>Check out my <a href="/blogroll/" title="Blogroll">blogroll</a></p>

      <p class="lead">July has been a much better month. It's been a month since I moved out of my home and started living in a rented flat. Got to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers live in London.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a lot of behind the scenes changes happening at work, all for the best, including moving to a SAFe (which is an agile framework) - that's the boring bit though, but this does mean we are slowly starting to do design work FIRST, rather than after changes have gone live! As part of this I've had a job title change to UI/UX Designer (was UI Frontend Developer) and on a sad note, our team has been split and put into different agile teams, but we are now all part of the Product team instead of development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Went into the company office in Wimbledon - second time in almost three years - but unfortunately it was to say goodbye to a colleague who's leaving for a 2-year round the world trip on her motorbike - which everyone is very jealous off - including me!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Have been spending too much money, but it's all stuff I needed for the flat.  I've now been in my rented flat for over a month!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Got a dining table which also happens to be a pool and table tennis table! Bargain 3 in 1, and we have yet to use it as a dining table and I still need to get seating for it - the plan is to get two benches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Got a freezer (small counter top one) and washing machine - both of which are in the tiny utility room (no room in the kitchen for the freezer) - but at least I didn't need to buy a fridge as one came with the flat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My girlfriend and I went to London to see the Red Hot Chilli Peppers play live at the Tottenham Hotspurs stadium - it was an amazing gig and some great supporting acts including The Roots!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrated our five-month anniversary by taking my girlfriend out for a steak meal at our favourite restaurant - Miller &amp; Carter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I've kept this post and my previous one on the short side, as I'm quite behind on posting these. Hopefully now the dust has started to settle with my personal stuff, I should be able to focus on more tech stuff too.</p>

      <p class="lead">June was a really shit month. I lost my best friend. The relationship between my ex-wife went from amicable to hostile, which forced me to move out.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>I’m not 100% sure what happened. I think has ex just snapped. It all started with her telling me that I needed to get rid of “my dog”, Kobe, because he had aggressively barked at a delivery person who entered our garden without ringing the bell. But also, he had been aggressively barking at my eldest daughter.</p>
<p>I was very upset, anyone would be, she didn't give me any time to try and fix the issue with my dog and my eldest child - the issue being she didn't like him and thus ignored him all the time and believe he just disowned her - my reaction was to just walk away, and I stopped speaking to her and everyone in the house for the next few days. She didn’t like this and that’s when things turned hostile.</p>
<p>Spent all my spare time trying to find a charity or someone that could re-home him, but every charity I spoke to were inundated with 'covid dogs' that they still don't have room for any more. My local RSPCA had a three-month wait just to be seen.</p>
<p>After a week I was accused of not doing anything about &quot;getting rid of the dog&quot;, was accused of damaging her car and told that she felt threatened in her own home, and that she would not be returning until the dog was gone, oh and she also reported me to the police!</p>
<p>I didn't do anything to her car or make any kind of threats - the police never came to see me, but I do know she did report me as I was given the reference number.</p>
<p>Then I was told he needed to go at the end of the week, or she would not be coming back home to look after the children - I had run out of time and options - no one would take him and I couldn't find anywhere to rent that would allow pets - not even Kennels had space.</p>
<p>I was left with only one choice, and it was one of the hardest choices I've ever had to make - Kobe was put to sleep.</p>
<p>I believe a lot of what happened is down to my ex-wife's boyfriend. He did not like Kobe and was scared of him. As soon as Kobe was gone, he and his dog moved into my house.</p>
<h4>Moved out</h4>
<p>After losing Kobe I never went back to my house, I just went to my girlfriend's house and I continued searching for a flat to rent. I did find a house (that needed a lot of work) but I loved it, but someone else beat me to getting an offer accepted.</p>
<p>I found a flat I liked after seeing a few, and I started the process and discovered that due to Brexit I now have to prove my right to rent in the UK, I knew about having to prove my right to work, just not renting too!</p>
<p>I moved into the flat on the 16th of June.</p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>I found out about one of those Axe and Knife throwing place that was only about an hour away from Suffolk and I took the kids for a day out, and we had so much fun - we will definitely be returning - checkout <a href="https://urbanxtreme.co.uk" title="UrbanXtreme">UrbanXtreme</a> in Colchester.</p>
<p>Spent the rest of June moving stuff from my house into the flat, as well as having to buy so many things - from a bed to cutlery to washing machine and freezer. It was an expensive month, even though I only bought the essentials to start off with.</p>
<p>That's all for this month. I'm hoping in the future I will be writing about happier things happening in my life and maybe even get back to working on side projects and writing about code.</p>

Over the last ten years, technology has transformed almost every aspect of our lives before we've had time to stop and question it. In every home; on every desk; in every palm - a plasma screen; a monitor; a smartphone - a black mirror of our 21st Century existence.</p>

In a dystopian 2071 devastated by air pollution, the survival of humanity depends on the Black Knights — and they’re far from your average delivery men.</p>

<p>I don't care about being 'found' on search engines these days, as I don't need it to get freelance work because I rarely do freelance work these days anyway.</p>

      <p class="lead">May did not end on a happy note, unfortunately. I’m now technically homeless, and I no longer have my dog.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Got to do some freelance work for one of my existing clients. They needed me to do some updates to their WordPress website. I did not build this website - it looks great visually, but working with it and WP was a nightmare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing different at work, still a very slow pace. The change over to working with the SAFe methodology is going very slowly - still loads of meetings about work. Best thing about it is that I'm just doing design work and don't even have Docker installed</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Went on a mountain bike ride with my mate matt, his son and my son on an actual mountain bike trail in Tunstall forest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Told my daughter about how much fun the bike ride was that she wanted to - off I went on another ride with my daughter Tasha the following weekend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm not a football fan, haven't been since I was a teenager. I don't hate football, I do watch some of the World Cup games. But I got to go to the Women's FA Cup final with my daughter and what a match for my first ever time being at a football game in a stadium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This month my girlfriend and I celebrated our 3-month anniversary and I surprised her with tickets to see Red Hot Chilli Peppers - her favourite band whom she has never been to see live</p>
</li>
</ul>
<details>
    <summary>Content Warning: pet death</summary>
    <p>Things at home went from amicable to hostile very quickly during the last week of May. Our second dog has been aggressively barking at our eldest daughter, and my ex-wife (whom I shared a house with since the separation) told me that my dog needed to go.</p>
    <p>I spent all week trying to find a charity that would take him in for rehoming. I was very upset - he was there for me when my ex decided to end our marriage. So I stopped talking to her. She didn't like this and went off on a mission to make my life a living hell.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately on Saturday the 4th of June my beautiful boy was put to sleep - my ex sent me a text on that Saturday morning that time was up, and he needed to go now. 😭</p>

      <p class="lead">Been feeling a lot better about my personal situation, celebrated a 2-month anniversary with my girlfriend. Went bowling with my children, and my eldest celebrated turning fifteen.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Nothing much happening at work, and I've had enough, so it's time to move on. I handed in my notice and have to work a three-month notice period. I'll be sad to leave my team, but I'm no good to anyone if I'm not motivated at work.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whilst driving back from London and having several diversions due to roadworks, I hit a massive pothole so ended up having to change my wheel on the side of a busy road at 2am! Luckily, as it turned out, I didn't new a new alloy, just a new tyre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kobe, my Dobermann was castrated, and I also got them to remove his rear (dangly) dewclaws</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Celebrated a 2-month anniversary with my girlfriend by going for a steak at Miller and Carter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decided I needed to do more with my children, so we went bowling and had a lot of fun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My eldest child turned 15 - I feel ancient! And to celebrate, I took her to the cinema to watch <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/evil_dead_rise" title="Evil Dead Rise">Evil Dead Rise</a></p>

<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bought an Apple Watch (the SE model) as My Garmin watch stopped working. Quite enjoying the way it works with my iPhone and MacBook Pro</li>
<li>Since I got a PS5 at the beginning of the year I'd not used it much so I decided to get a PSP+ subscription and started playing some included classic games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken" title="Tekken">Tekken</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_Racer" title="Ridge Racer">Ridge Racer</a> but also started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stray_(video_game)" title="Stray">Stray</a></li>
<li>My girlfriend has met my dog and two of my children - and they all approved of her 😁</li>
<li>Went to an Ipswich Theatre for a talk called - Psychology of Serial Killers with my girlfriend and my eldest daughter, we're all into this stuff 😁</li>

      <p class="lead">Well, February was definitely an improvement for me. Better focused at work and actually got some work done. Started dating someone and it's going well. The house is now listed for sale and have got a mortgage in principle. Things are a lot better now.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Been re-designing a secure messaging UI to make it look more like a chat app. It has been a fun design ticket to work on, I'm now just going through feedback and making some changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We hired a contractor to finish the decoration of the newly converted loft. I also finished laying the laminate flooring in the other loft room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The house was listed for sale towards the end of the month, but we've not had any viewings yet. We have now hired a second estate agent to market the house for sale, so hopefully we'll get some viewings soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My ex has now filled the paperwork for the divorce. It's all done online, and it has been reviewed, but now we have to wait until July when we'll be asked again to confirm both parties agree to the divorce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I've started dating someone - it's all very new, but I've been really happy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have a mortgage offer in principle from two lenders and have found a house I like - just need to wait for someone to make an offer on my house, and then I will be in a better position to also make an offer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm also keen to change my car - my car was chosen by my ex and I don't really like the memories it comes with. Considering getting a Range Rover Velar.</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="lead">A very slow month, which is normal as we approach Christmas. I turned 41 this month. Also, some personal stuff has happened, and I'm not ready to talk about yet, but It's why this post is so late.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We had a weekend trip to Liverpool for a martial arts tournament - Kuk Sool Won, where my wife did her final testing and promoted to a black belt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Daughter number 2 won 2 gold and 1 silver medals at the tournament for doing techniques, sparring and staff skills. The other two of my children entered, but both were recovering from the flu so didn't do too well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was my birthday and I turned 41. Just a number, it's no big deal for me, and I don't feel like I am that age. Didn't do anything to celebrate this - but did treat myself to 3 pairs of trainers (skateboarding, basketball and general daily trainers) and new walking boots. My wife got me a Minnesota Timberwolves hoodie.</p>

      <p class="lead">Another slow month with work and on the personal side of things again. I guess that's normal now that I'm not doing contract work, there's less going on.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lots of small bug fixes and pixel wrangling ready for an internal launch of the project I've been working on. It slowed down after the launch, and we're now starting to focus on building new features again.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I created a <a href="/books" title="Books">books</a> section on my website for me to keep track of books I've read. I deleted my Goodreads account a while back and have been using <a href="https://bookwyrm.social/" title="Bookwyrm">Bookwyrm</a> to keep track, but I wanted to also have it on my own website as a backup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started creating a links section on my website as a place to hold all social links in order to only need one link to add to social-media sites - a bit like my own LinkTree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm sure you're all aware of the chaos happening over at Twitter, it's difficult hearing about all the lay-offs and how that must be affecting those people and their families at a time like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I have now made <a href="https://mastodon.social/@juanfernandes" title="Juan Fernandes on Mastodon">mastodon</a> my primary social network, I still have a Twitter account that I check occasionally, but everything is now being posted to the fediverse first then syndicated to twitter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something that made me smile I saw while Twitter’s new owner took over and the mass exodus happened was someone referring to him as Melon Husk 🤣</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expensive car month - needed a new tyre, new brake pads and brake discs. This is the first time since we've owned the car that we've needed to replace brakes so that's not bad going for 3 years. Not ideal spending just over £600, but we have a trip to Liverpool in November for a martial arts event, and it's a long drive for us, so we needed to make sure the car was safe to drive that distance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to save money, we decided to attempt to lay/install the laminate wood flooring in our new loft rooms. We figured since the space is new it will be fairly straight and level, thus hopefully it will be easier to lay the flooring. This is the first time I've done this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the first time in my life, I was offered a flu jab 😬 - I guess now I'm considered old; now that I am 40 🤣</p>
</li>
</ul>

      <p class="lead">Bit of a slow month. I started working on a Books section on my website and worked on a complex membership table build.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I spent some time building a complex membership table build and am planning a blog post about it. I was not able to replicate the designers vision 100% - I got pretty close. I wonder if other web designers would have solved it the same way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I've renamed this section to projects, was freelance, but makes more sense to talk about side projects now that I'm not actively taking on new freelance work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since I took a deep dive into being more privacy-aware and wanting to own more of my content, I deleted my Goodreads a few years ago, ended up trying a few alternatives (better privacy) but then ended up using two services and sort of stopped logging books I'd read. So I've started adding a 'read' <a href="/books" title="Books">books</a> section to my website.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One of my favourite hip hop/gangsta rap artists, Coolio, sadly passed away. I spent the day listening to his music.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I ended up visiting the local A+E with excruciating kidney pains which turned out to be kidney stones. I was sent for a CT scan which happened a few days after the hospital visit. It was confirmed I have kidney stones and now I am waiting to speak to or be seen by a urologist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My daughter and I got new skateboards. I just got a new board; just moved my trucks and wheels to it. She got a complete skateboard. I attempted cutting my name into the grip tape but it messed up when trying to stick it down that it ripped, so I bought see-through grip tape instead so the blueish colour from the top of the board can be seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My youngest is still ill but doctors still don't know the cause. Quite a few trips to the hospital for blood tests and doctor visits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have added all the music I listed to this month - previously it was just podcasts but I'm not really finding the right time to listen to podcasts.</p>
</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>August saw quite a lot of change for my family and me. We've switched to a mostly plant-based diet and have also started to venture into minimalism.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Been involved in a redesign project of one of the company's products - but not only are we doing a redesign, but the devs are also rebuilding the application to use Micro frontends and turn everything into components.</p>
<p>Doing both projects at the same time was not a great idea. So much wasted time was spent trying to get the local dev environment to work so I could change some CSS files.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>I've not done any freelance work for a while now. I'm still waiting for a client meeting to discuss some final updates to their website and adding a new feature. We've not been able to align our schedules yet. Once that work is complete, that will likely be it for freelance work.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>August saw quite a lot of change for my family and me. We've switched to a mostly plant-based diet and have also started to venture into minimalism. I say venture because we've only just started with the basics - getting rid of all the stuff we don't need, decluttering and reducing what we bring into our home.</p>
<h3>Switched to a mostly plant based diet</h3>
<p>We decided that now was a good time to reconsider our diet, food (meat) consumption and its impact on our planet. Will a family of five stopping their meat and fish consumption make that much of a difference? Most people will say no, but we believe that it will. The more people that reduce their meat consumption, the more companies will notice, and we'll get more vegan products on the supermarket shelves.</p>
<p>It's too early to say whether it's had any health benefits yet, but we have noticed it in our wallets - the food shop is a lot cheaper when you don't buy loads of meat products. One thing we quickly learnt was that the 'fake meat' alternatives aren't great; it also made it a lot easier to switch to this new diet by not trying to find like-for-like replacements - we've bought a few vegan recipes books and are continuing to cook most of our meals from scratch but without meat!</p>
<h3>Becoming minimalists</h3>
<p>As part of this venture, we have given away a lot of stuff we've had in our house for ages that served no purpose, just sat collecting dust. We gave a lot to charity; unfortunately, some stuff, including old furniture had to be taken to our local recycling centre (aka the tip/dump).</p>
<p>My wife did most of the house sorting - I did my office and the garage, which had so much stuff; it was an obstacle course to get to the other end of the garage!</p>
<h3>House and garage clear out</h3>
<p>Some of the things I got rid of are books I've read - I'm keeping all my Stephen King hardbacks, but all the paperbacks I've read are going to a charity shop - where they will likely get read again, rather than sitting on a shelf collecting dust.</p>
<p>The garage has been our dumping ground since we moved into this house about nine years ago - everything that we didn't fit want in the house we put in the garage, old furniture that was too good for the tip, we kept when we got a replacement. There were just so many things we didn't need or use in the garage.</p>
<p>But also in the house - as soon as you start looking at cupboards, drawers, under the bed - you start seeing so many things you've kept out of guilt or just because it was given to you or you spent money on it, but has not been used in years - why keep it and continue making the house cluttered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't take a before photo of the garage - so you will just have to imagine how bad it was - you could barely see the floor!</p>
<p>This photo shows most of the contents of our garage, spread out on our patio in different categories ready to be sorted.</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/juanfernandes/q_auto,f_auto/v1663008009/garage-contents.jpg" alt="Most of the contents of our garage spreadout on the patio">
<p>And this photo shows what our garage currently looks like. Great progress so far - still have a few more boxes to sort out and I need to install hooks for things like ladders etc.</p>

<h3>Glamping holiday in Yorkshire</h3>
<p>Our one and only family holiday this year saw us returning to <a href="https://kingfisher-lakes.com/" title="Kingfisher Lakes">Kingfisher Lakes</a> in Yorkshire for a glamping holiday. This year we stayed in a big canvas tent instead of a bell tent because our friends and their children joined us. We once again had a great time and enjoyed kayaking on the lake, countryside and seaside walks. No fire pit this year because of heat and with everything around being so dry and prone to wildfires - but that was ok.</p>

<h2>That's all</h2>
<p>So as you can tell, it has been a busy month full of change - but it has been a great month. We know it's going to take a while to get used to being on a meat and fish-free diet - but there is so much more choice out there - it's just a mindset change.</p>
<p>Don't worry I am not going to try and persuade you to give up meat or get rid of all your possessions - it's just a lifestyle my wife and I have made for us and our children.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>I'm way behind on these monthly blog posts that I've decided to forget about the last few months. There hasn't been much to write about these last few months, plus I've just been too busy with life and house stuff. Anyway, June was a good month; I'm glad the contractors have finished the loft conversion project - we now need to decorate and furnish. How was your month?</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I've been working on a cool project which I can't say much about. But its one of those projects that really makes you use your brain! I'm using 11ty and TailwindCSS, although the project will be built using VueJS but that will be done by the developers in the team. There lots of tricky design elements that I am enjoying getting my teeth into. And best of all I don't need to do any JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Finally finished and launched the <a href="https://www.arrival-lifts.co.uk/" title="Arrival Lift Services">Arrival Lift Services</a> website 🎉. Really pleased with the design and also the performance. Built using 11ty and TailwindCSS and some vanilla JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>The loft conversion project is finished... well almost, the contractors are done but we still need to decorate it. We decided to do that ourselves to reduce the cost a bit. We are really happy with most of it, there are a few things that we aren't happy with that cannot be changed right now - specifically the staircase going across the window. When we have more money we want to change the window for a different style and move it up. At the top of the stairs we're going to add a glass ballustrade so we can sit on a low sofa and enjoy the view of the green fileds in front. Due to new fire regulations all the bedrooms have had to have fire doors fitted, which are ok, but makes the place feel like a hotel.</p>
<p>Looking forward to making use of it once we've decorated it all!</p>

<p>The outside entertainment area which was also finished this year has now had the electrics done and two patio heaters installed. I now just need to finish building the kitchen area.</p>

      <p>Not a lot happened in March which is not too bad, apart from the lack of work and downtime at work, which makes for a long and boring day. Continue working on a freelance website project. (Been a bit behind on my Monthly Notes)</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Migrated a client's email hosting to a better host. I used to manage this client's email hosting when I had a reseller account with that host, but when I moved to Guru, my client wanted to stay. But they have had too many issues with that host that they wanted me to help them move to Krystal Hosting</li>
<li>Continued working on the Arrival Lift Services website - all content has now been added, just tweaking and minor fixes to go</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've had a lot of downtime at work due to broken local dev environment issues which have meant I could only work on the style guide - but there was only so much you can do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Someone recommended I see a Neuropath who may be able to help with the skin rash (food/gut related) I've now had for a few years. So I found one and I had my first appointment</li>
<li>Due to downtime at work and everything else I've been very unmotivated to do anything, even side projects</li>
<li>My middle child joined a football team and is now a registered player with The FA</li>
<li>Eldest child joined a basketball club briefly but she didn't like it that all they did was drills and didn't play any matches</li>
<li>My mother in law got covid but thankfully it didn't affect her too bad and she was back to normal after a week. It just meant I had to do a lot more diving our kids around to after school clubs</li>

      <p>Very short update for this month. Mostly personal updates, a lot of articles read and some freelance work. (Took me a while to get this posted.)</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continued work on the redesign and rebuild of the <a href="https://www.arrival-lifts.co.uk" title="Arrival Lift Services">Arrival Lift Services</a> website</li>
<li>Posted my <a href="/notes/monthly-notes-january-2022/" title="Monthly Notes: January 2022">January Monthly notes</a></li>
<li>Removed Forestry.io CMS from my website - I ran into an issue I couldn't resolve and support didn't get back to me. I only had a CMS to learn and test features for when using it with client websites</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>We got a new family pet - a 4 month old Doberman that we named Kobe - now our children are older it took a lot longer to choose a name everyone liked</li>
<li>After a lot of research we decided to get a Traeger BBQ and Smoker - its a pellet wood one and its a new concept for us, but we figure it would be cheaper to run, plus easy for both of us to use</li>
<li>Got round to setting up the fairy lights we bought in last years Amazon Prime Day sales in our outside entertainment area</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>Wowsers January flew by. I started the year with a detox. Set a reading goal of ten books - I only managed four last year. I am planning on reading at least two articles a day and auto-tweet links to them.</p>
<p>I'm aiming to keep up with my monthly notes, as I only managed about six months last year. I plan on making these quicker to read and thus more of a short-form list notes instead - in the hopes it will also be quicker for me to get them written and posted.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Started working on a website redesign project for an existing client</li>
<li>Finished one-page website design and build for an exiting client using 11ty and TailwindCSS</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deleted hundreds of unread Instapaper articles - this is now an annual task as I save way more articles than I can read</li>
<li>To help combat the above issue I'm aiming to read two articles per day and I'm auto tweeting those read article links for some accountability</li>
<li>Updated the family Minecraft server to 1.18 and upgraded ram to the max of 16Gb. Also updated Java, which is always a bit of pain on Linux</li>
<li>Wrote and posted my <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/2021-year-in-review/">2021 year in review</a> - late as usual</li>
<li>Did you know that when you turn forty you get a free NHS health check? No, I didn't either. Mine was ok, I expected worse</li>
<li>As part of me trying to figure out the cause of this skin rash I have (mentioned in my 2021 year in review post) I did a liver detox - cutting out alcohol, sugar and coffee - no difference to the rash or anything else</li>
<li>Our garden &quot;entertainment area&quot; (sheltered decking) - the structure is done and I now need to plan the kitchen I'm going to build in there (BBQ, Smoker &amp; Pizza Oven)</li>

      <p>Not much to note for the month of June. Been busy with my permanent job and working to get the new Surbiton Tyre  and Wheel website finished.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've now been at my permanent job with <a href="https://www.intelliflo.com/uk">intelliflo</a> for four months 🎉 - which is a bit longer than my preferred contract length of 3 months.</li>
<li>I've spent most of this month working on making a third-party in-app support tool look as if it's part of our application. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of <code>!important</code> use to override their CSS with ours. I'm don't like the idea of using a third-party tool but it's a complex and huge application - for us to do this internally would take a while. I even managed to get the interactive tooltips to inherit our customers custom themes!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continued working on the Surbiton Tyre and Wheel website -  mostly working on creating the templates to use with Forestry.io CMS and adding the content as well</li>
<li>Been having a few issues with CSP + Webmentions but I think I have got them sorted out now</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Been learning to skateboard with my daughter (11)</li>
<li>I had my first covid jab 💉🎉</li>
<li>Been doing lots of work on the garden</li>
</ul>

      <p>Another short notes post for this month. Been busy at my new permanent job at intelliflo - learning the ropes and how to be a permanent employee again. Plus freelance work. I've had my google free phone now for over a month and I finally got round to adding some new features to my website.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finished and launched the new <a href="https://gratuu.com/">Gratuu.com</a> website. Designed in Sketch and built using 11ty and TailwindCSS. Some of the content will change once the app is launched</li>
<li>I continued working on the new Surbiton Tyre and Wheel website build after a long pause whilst I waited for the client to pay the next stage invoice and provide the content. I'm still waiting for content but have been able to continue creating templates ready for CMS implementation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side Projects</h2>
<p>Now that I have a permanent job again, my website is my new side project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Finally got round to <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/notes/changelog-added-webmentions/">implementing webmentions</a> on my website. This has been on my to-do list for a while now. It wasn't the easiest thing to implement and I wouldn't have managed it if it wasn't for all the people that have done this and shared their code</li>
<li>Something else that I've had on my to-do list for a while was re-doing my ServiceWorker script. The previous version had been on my website for a while and it was something I quickly knocked up when ServiceWorkers first came to my attention. But it wasn't clearing old caches so returning visitors weren't seeing my latest content and styling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've now had my new phone for a month and also means I have been completely Google-free for that long. Its been an interesting journey and I need to write up a review of the Fairphone 3+ and my deep dive into being more privacy-aware and more deliberate about what data I share</li>
</ul>

      <p>Since adding Content Security Policies to my website, I need to add a sha for any inline scripts I use - I only use one, which initiates my ServiceWorker.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting how to genetate shas. Making a note for future reference.</p>
<p>You can generate a hash using openssl:</p>
<pre><code>echo -n 'doSomething();' | openssl sha256 -binary | openssl base64
</code></pre>

      <h2>My website now has web mentions 🎉</h2>
<p>For those who don't know what webmentions are; its a way to show social media comments and interactions on your website. If I post a blog post to twitter and someone comments or likes that tweet, that will be added to the blog post.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/working-an-inside-ir35-contract/" title="Working an inside IR35 contract">Working an inside IR35 contract</a></p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGreenGreek">Sia Karamalegos</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/messypixels">Angélique Weger</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mxbck">Max Böck</a> for their blog posts and their code, because without it I wouldn't have managed to add this to my website.</p>

      <p>TIL: If you create a post with a title that has uppercase letters, like IR35 - the URL will have those capital letters in your file system, but in the live URL they will be lowercase.</p>
<p>This may be obvious to some, but I had not noticed until I started working on implementing webmentions on my website.</p>
<p>A webmention recorded against <code>/blog/working-an-inside-ir35-contract/</code> will not show mentions for <code>/blog/working-an-inside-IR35-contract/</code>.</p>
<p>Took me a few hours to figure out that was why webmentions were not showing for that blog post!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>March has been a busy month with me going back to permanent employment and starting a new job at intelliflo. Finishing my last contract. Finishing a freelance project and starting another one.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>If you missed my <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/notes/monthly-notes-february-2021/">previous months' notes</a> - I got a new job! Over the past year, I spent a lot of time thinking about work and the future - with IR35 looming and all the other things that the government is doing or will do that will affect contractors - plus the fact that I now owe £8k loan I had to take out to be able to pay my corporate taxes - I decided to go back to permanent employment.</p>
<p>So it's been three weeks at my new job now and it's going great - have already got down to some coding after a couple of weeks of mandatory training and the setting up of the brand new laptop and local development environment.</p>
<p>Considering it's a new process for me and the business with new kit and remote IT support - I think it went very well.</p>
<p>I'm also part of a great diverse team which I'm looking forward to getting to know better.</p>
<p>Funnily enough - my first piece of work was to apply the new company branding to the project I worked on when I first worked at intelliflo as a contractor back in 2017 - their Developer Hub and App Store.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>March saw the launch of the new website for Property with Potential. The new website uses <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" title="Tailwind CSS">TailwindCSS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/" title="Alpine JS">AlpineJS</a> - two frameworks that I had never used before. I also used 11ty to build the templates ready for the client to implement with their backend tech stack.</p>
<p>I am pleased with how it turned out and so is the client. Even if it did take longer than planned - but we did add extra work; but I also ended up having to take on a contract at the same time.</p>
<h3>New Project</h3>
<p>I also started another website build project - Surbiton Tyre &amp; Wheel. I decided to stick with TailwindCSS and off course <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" title="Eleventy">11ty</a>. 🖤</p>
<p>So far I have coded up all the different components - cards plus variants, header, footer and main navigation etc.</p>
<p>Then I started refining all the components - making sure they work well in small screen devices as well as larger ones.</p>
<p>The most complex component is the main navigation  - as it has three levels of links. Top-level links followed by two sets of sub nav links.</p>
<p>Normally I would have found a codepen and just changed the code to fit my requirements but this time I decided I would code the entire thing from scratch including some basic JS for showing and hiding the menu on mobile as well as the sub-nav links.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I was on a podcast!! It was my first time being on one - it was great fun - but I was a tad nervous. I haven't been able to listen to it through yet - cringing at the sound of my voice. 😬</p>
<p>You can listen to it here - <a href="https://makelifeworkpodcast.com/tingle-of-completion/">Make Life Work - 5: Tingle of Completion</a></p>
<h3>Car</h3>
<p>Since I've been home for over a year now I haven't needed to use my car in that time - in fact, a month into the first lockdown my road tax was due so I decided to SORN my car (SORN means you don't pay the road tax - but you cannot drive your car on public roads).</p>
<p>Now that I have gone back to permanent employment and it's fully remote I won't be making those long journeys to a contract like I used to do. So the car won't get used very often when life goes back to some normality as we had before covid (BC times) - so all this is to say that my lovely red Mercedes-Benz A-Class is for sale. 😢</p>
<p>This meant I needed to get the car taxed, serviced and MOT'd - and my insurance also needed to be renewed. I reduced my mileage on the insurance to 6k per annum - which is the lowest you can choose to reduce he price a bit.</p>
<p>But selling a car when you live this far out and during a pandemic means zero interest in the car. Hopefully, when restrictions are lifted and it's safer to do so, there will be more interest.</p>

<h2>That's it</h2>
<p>That's it for March's monthly notes - it's been a busy month with starting a new permanent job and finishing off freelance work - meaning I've been working more hours a day which meant I've had less time for reading, listening to podcasts, blogging and even watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>Until next month - have a great one!</strong></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>February was quite a busy month work-wise. Finishing the Property with Prospect website as well as finishing and presenting the design for the new Surbiton Tyre and Wheels website.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>First things first - I have some very exciting news to share - I have accepted a job offer for a permanent position as a frontend developer at a company called <a href="https://www.intelliflo.com/uk">Intelliflo</a>.</p>
<p>I was approached by the CTO at Intelliflo via LinkedIn - who asked me if I would consider going back to work with them but on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>I said I would only be able to consider it if the job was fully remote - after a few weeks and a few Zoom calls, they made me an offer that was hard to say no to.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Finished building the Property with Prospect website. I have enjoyed working with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">AlpineJS</a> on this project.</p>
<p>I also ended up doing an extra template for this project that wasn't in the scope - we identified a need for a property details page for each property. This was something I mentioned to the client as it was another way of keeping visitors on the website for longer.</p>
<p>After the client agreed - I sketched it on paper and then jumped straight into code and built the property details template.</p>
<p>Finished the re-design for a new client website and we presented the finished design to the client over a Zoom meeting where my designer, Fern Taylor walked the client through the design and our decisions.</p>
<p>The client is really happy with the new design and we got the go-ahead to start building the new website.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'm almost done with Gmail</p>
<p>Spent a few hours this month going through my password manager and checking which websites/services still used my Gmail email address and either deleted the account or changed email addresses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blocked Gmail on business domain name emails</p>
<p>Finally got fed up with all the spam coming from @gmail.com addresses that I decided to block my email server from receiving emails from Gmail accounts. Drastic measures I know but it was needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listed my car for sale</p>
<p>Haven't used my car for about a year now since I've been working from home and also not leaving the house, I decided it was time to sell it. It's a great car but we have a family car and I don't need one right now. It has had 84 views but no interest so far</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using my new keyboard (<a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/">ZSA Moonlander</a>) all the time now</p>
<p>I got my new keyboard delivered at the beginning of February and I didn't use it all the time, but then after the first week, I decided to put my old keyboard away and just use the Moonlander full time. It's going alright - but it's been a steep learning curve.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Snow days</p>
<p>Our children enjoyed the few days of snow we got in February. I enjoyed watching them and our dog play in the snow. The dog especially as it was the first time he has seen snow. I also enjoyed a few days of drastically reduced vehicles going past our house as the only road in and out of our village was completely blocked by snowdrifts.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>January has been a good month with a steady flow of work and spending plenty of time with the family whilst making the most of being in lockdown. Although, it's been far too cold for me to muster the energy to go for runs or even walks.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Started 2021 with an existing contract - this is the third year in a row this has happened.</p>
<p>This month I continue my work on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs">Defra</a> Internal Services applications working with a team of IBM developers. I've been building a few prototypes using the <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs">GOV.UK Prototype Kit</a>.</p>
<p>One of the prototypes was a typical Gov web service project for DWI, whilst other work was still using the prototype kit but required me to heavily customise its appearance so that we could use it as a dashboard application for internal applications.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>I continue working on the <a href="https://propertytorenovate.co.uk" title="Current version of the Property with Prospect website">Property with Prospect</a> website and finished working on the results template. Just have a few snags to work on before I hand over the code to the client.</p>
<p>This template was the biggest piece of work as it has two types of property card layouts, has search filters, a modal that slides in and dropdown menus.</p>
<p>For all of the interactivity I opted to use <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine/">Alpine JS</a> - this is the first time using it. It's known as the Tailwind of JavaScript. I quite enjoyed using it, it's very easy to use and learn on the go.</p>
<p>I did try and create the dropdown menus using vanilla JavaScript but I wasn't able to figure out how to get the dropdown menu to collapse when the user clicks anywhere on the page. So I then looked at the TailwindCSS examples and noticed they were using alpine JS for the modals etc.</p>
<h3>New client</h3>
<p>Took on the hosting of a new website for an existing client as they launched a podcast and a new website for it - check it the <a href="https://www.goodbusinesstalking.com/">Good Business Talking podcast</a>.</p>
<h3>New client web design project</h3>
<p>This month I hired a designer to work with me on designing a new website for my client.  My client accepted my design proposal at the end of last year and I got the go-ahead in January.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have not designed a website for a freelance project. I decided that since designing is not my strongest skill, and I was already quite busy with a contract and another freelance project, it made sense to hire a designer. So I hired one of my best friends and great designer, Fern Taylor. She was unfortunately made redundant at the end of last year due to covid, she worked for a theatre company working on their website. FYI, she is currently looking for a permanent role, if you know anyone looking for a senior designer.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Not much happening on the personal side, still in lockdown mode and staying home as much as possible with just the occasional walks with the family and the dog. Ventured out for a blood test - trying to get to the bottom of my skin rash. Haven't had the results yet, but I know the doctors are very busy at the moment with covid vaccinations.</p>
<p>I've continued watching loads of Netflix. Finished watching The Office US and the UK version as well. Continued watching Lost in Space and Big Mouth.</p>
<p>Also, spent far too long writing my <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/2020-year-in-review/">2020: Year in review</a> blog post. I've been doing these for a few years now, but since it wasn't a great year, I struggled to get it finished but got it done in the end.</p>
<h3>Office staircase</h3>
<p>For about two years I've needed a new staircase into my office above our garage. The previous owners didn't look after the wooden staircase and it seems left leaves to rot on the platform which caused the wood to rot - including the supporting posts.</p>
<p>This was going to be something I was going to attempt myself as a side project but it was a bit of a daunting job and I didn't have the time, so I hired a professional and they completed the job in a week - much faster than I would have managed and probably a lot cheaper too if you account for the mistakes I would have likely made.</p>
<p>I don't have any photos of what the staircase used to look like, but let's just say the platform I stepped out onto from the office was only about a square foot, off to the left, after I removed all the rotten wood.</p>
<p>Here is my new office staircase.</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/juanfernandes/q_auto,f_auto/new-staircase.jpg" alt="External staircase going into office space above double garage">
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I published a new blog post, <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/improved-website-because-of-csp/">How I improved my website because of Content Security Policies</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Not a very busy month as the year comes to an end and things slow down ready for the Christmas break. Spent quite a bit of time working on improving my website by forcing myself to adhere to my strict Content Security Policies.</strong></p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finished building the homepage template for my clients' website redesign. This is my first project using TailwindCSS. Its been a great learning experience but I'm still not convinced TailwindCSS will replace Sass for me</li>
<li>Continued with my new contract at Defra as an interaction designer setting up a repository for components and page layouts used within internal systems</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>After applying quite a strict set of Content Security Policies to my website a few weeks ago and breaking images, inline CSS and JS - I spent a few hours making changes to my website to fix those issues and better comply with my CSP rules - blog post coming soon</li>
<li>Finally got round to changing my master branch on my websites repo to main - see this <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/easily-rename-your-git-default-branch-from-master-to-main">post by Scott Hanselman</a></li>

      <p><strong>Don't you hate when you go from having no work to then having way too much work and it starts pilling up on you? That was November for me.</strong></p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>In November I continued working on my current freelance project - the property listings website I am re-designing. Most of the design work is finished - the only thing I have left to design is the Filter Results interface - my first idea didn't work. But I decided to pause the design and move onto coding the homepage template as the client is keen to start working on the backend.</p>
<p>I also started doing design research for my next freelance project for a tyre and wheel company based in Surrey. I've just been researching design inspiration and interface ideas.</p>
<p>Normally I have enough money saved up to pay off the corporation tax at the end my accounting year - but due to covid and having no work since April, I had to use the tax reserve to pay my salary. So I did quite a scary thing - I applied for a business bounce back loan to help pay off corporation tax. 😬</p>
<p>The loan is interest-free for the first 12 months - this is a government-funded scheme - so I will aim to get it paid within that year to avoid any interest.</p>
<h3>New Contract</h3>
<p>Just towards the end of the month, I started a new contract as an Interaction Designer at Defra working on an internal project alongside IBM. It's been a lot of catching up on the project so far. I'll be working with an IBM developer to design components that aren't in the GOV UK Prototype kit or Design System for use on internal Defra websites.</p>
<p>This contract is inside IR35 - as it seems like most GOV contracts are now - and this meant I've had to become employed by an umbrella company.</p>
<p>That meant leaving my limited company for the duration of this contract - this just made tax easier - I could have stayed employed by both companies but I may have ended up on an emergency tax code.</p>
<p>The whole experience of an inside IR35 contract so far has been rubbish - <em>would not recommend</em>.</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>Due to being quite busy with work, I have paused the courses that I have in progress - <a href="https://www.learnjavascript.today">Learn JavaScript</a> and <a href="https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/">Learn Eleventy From Scratch</a> but I have started learning TailwindCSS - not because I wanted to, as I'm still not sold on utility first CSS methodologies but I needed to learn it for my current freelance project as it was a requirement from the client. As a contractor/freelancer it's always good to learn new tools.</p>

      <p>October was a surprisingly busy month which is a good thing after months without any work. It's good to be back in work mode but must not forget to continue working on my business, website and side projects.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Had an idea for a new side project, something that involves 11ty and naturally I bought a domain name for it, so now it needs to happen because it's real once you buy the domain name, right?</p>
<p>It's nothing grand and I don't want to make a big deal about it, just something for me to continue learning 11ty and Nunjucks.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
<li>I created a <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/uses/" title="Juan Fernandes 'Uses' page">/uses</a> page and got a pull request approved to have it added to <a href="https://uses.tech" title="Uses.tech">uses.tech</a></li>
<li>Wrote a blog post about <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/creating-a-sitemap-file-with-11ty/" title="Creating a Sitemap file with Eleventy">Creating a Sitemap file with 11ty</a></li>
<li>I worked on improving the security of my website by researching and adding security headers on Netlify - I have a blog post to finish on this.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://web.dev/maskable-icon/" title="About Maskable Icons">maskable icon</a> - this is something new that Google has added to the list of requirements, which means that phones can mask your icon to make it fit with the users' theme - i.e. can it become a circle if it needs to.</li>
<li>Started looking into web monetisation - just basics to start off with, I signed up with Brave browser and verified my website so it can collect donations and also signed up with <a href="https://coil.com/" title="Coil">Coil</a> to be able to collect these donations - not that I'm expecting any. The plan is to also start giving donations to a website I use on a lot, like CSS Tricks etc - I have some digital currency that is just sitting in places and I have no idea what to do with it, so why not distribute it to content authors who I learn from.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Created and sent out three project proposals, two of which were accepted</li>
<li>Got two new client projects - a redesign of a property listing website and a new website for a tyre and wheels company</li>
<li>Out of those 2 proposals, one is for a new client</li>
<li>Continuing with freelance work as well as looking for contract work - looking at getting to a stage where I can start scheduling work in advance</li>
<li>Had one interview for an interaction designer contract with the ONS, but have not had any feedback for it, I know they said things are slowing in government, but I'm assuming they went with someone else.</li>
<li>Since I'm a one-person business I am always looking at how I can streamline my processes as well as looking at ways of minimising running costs - not that I have a lot of expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not long ago, I switched my business bank account to RBS from Santander - I was happy with Santander and the monthly bank charges were a fixed £7.50. But I moved to RBS so that I could get FreeAgent for free, which is available to companies with business accounts with RBS and NatWest - because FreeAgent is owned by them now.</p>
<p>But after the first year with RBS, they have turned out to be a lot more expensive than I had thought. On average, since lockdown, I've been paying at least £10 a month on charges - this was a lot more when I was working on-site with clients.</p>
<p>My plan now is to get a Monzo Business Account which is a fixed £5 a month, then use a self-hosted app solution for invoices and use Stripe for recurring invoices for my hosting customers.</p>

      <p>September flew by. Not much to report as it was a quiet month on the work and personal fronts. Launched a new client website and a got personal achievement too.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still no luck on the job front, I'm now considering going back to permanent work</li>
<li>Finished the martial arts website I've been working on - check it out - <a href="https://www.kuksoolwonwoodbridge.co.uk">Kuk Sool Won of Woodbridge</a> - built using HTML CSS/Sass, Nunjucks and Eleventy, hosted on Netlify</li>
<li>I sent a proposal for a new client website - waiting to hear back on whether it is going ahead</li>
<li>Two potential leads, one I need to prepare a proposal for</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>🎉 I completed the Couch to 5k program - YAY</li>
<li>Tried to continue running (Mon, Wed &amp; Fri) and then do a HiiT in between runs, but my body still dislikes the intensity of a HiiT.</li>

      <p>Augusts' monthly notes are mostly personal and shorter than usual as I didn't get up to much - and that's a good thing - we all need to know how to chill once in a while. 👍</p>
<h2>Break</h2>
<p>We had flights booked to Madeira, before COVID - we could only push the date forward, cancelling was not an option without a loss.</p>
<p>So we pushed it as far as we could, allowing enough time on our return for two weeks quarantine as my wife needed to be back for work in September.</p>
<p>Despite the COVID test on arrival at Madeira airport (it was not pleasant), travelling during this time was ok, the airport was not as busy as usual - but surprisingly still quite busy.</p>
<p>Wearing a face mask for about 4/5 hours was not nice, especially if, like me, you have a beard!</p>
<p>But after all those months in lockdown, isolation and all six of us cooped up in the house all the time, it was great being in Madeira for a week catching up with my parents and family.</p>
<h2>New family members</h2>
<p>No, we're not having another child - three is plenty! 😁 But one of our hens has become a mummy to two cute little chicks.</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/juanfernandes/q_auto,f_auto//v1599238091/chicks_nr96fj.jpg" alt="Mummy hen and her two baby chicks">
<p>She had been broody for a while - her first attempt wasn't successful. I decided to separate her from the other chickens and Sir Lancelot (our cockerel) and this allowed her to sit on her eggs in peace.</p>
<h2>Health</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of lockdown, I've had some sort of food-related allergy that manifested itself as a very itchy rash.</p>
<p>The first month I dismissed it as nothing to worry about it but it continued and got worse - I kept taking antihistamine tablets and started cutting out foods. At some point, I thought it was dairy that was causing the rash, but nope, it continued.</p>
<p>Five months later and I still get a rash every day, sometimes its really bad, other times its just a visible rash but not itchy.</p>
<p>I have it down to it potentially being coffee or caffeine!! 😮</p>
<p>I've been drinking decaf coffee for a week now but I am still getting the rash, it's not happened as often or as bad, but still happening enough for me to have to take an antihistamine.</p>
<h2>Office Update</h2>
<p>My new office chair has arrived - YAY. As mentioned in <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/notes/monthly-notes-july-2020/" title="Monthly Notes: July 2020">last months notes</a>, I went with the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/?rid=b98811&amp;utm_campaign=referral_block&amp;utm_source=Email_Automated&amp;utm_medium=cs_bulk_order&amp;utm_content=b98811&amp;utm_term=referrals_share" title="Autonomous Ergo Chair 2 - affiliate link">Autonomous Ergo Chair 2</a>. I went for this chair because it's highly recommended and a lot cheaper than the Herman Miller Aeron. 🙌</p>
<p>I'm still getting used to the new chair - still not sitting comfortably. Although the chair has many ways to adjust it - I'm being mindful of making too many adjustments at once. There's getting used to a new chair but also relearning how to sit properly after many years of not doing so, my body has become used to terrible sitting positions.</p>
<p><em>Is there a professional I can hire that will teach me how to sit at my desk? Serious question!</em></p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I'm still looking for my next contract, as either a frontend developer or an interaction designer, ideally remote only.</p>
<p>I'm keeping busy working on my friends' martial arts club website and improving my website.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>July has been a bit slow going as I slowly get back into web development, now that the homeschooling has ended and I'm cooking a lot less as my wife has now finished work.</p>
<p>I'm still looking for my next contract, but I do have some potential freelance projects coming up shortly. Things are looking up.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Just at the end of the month, I lost a web hosting client. I took over the managing of their website earlier this year as they wanted to have the website managed by a professional.</p>
<p>Losing a web hosting client is common enough - it happens, so I wasn't too bothered by them wanting to move on, but what did bother me was that I believe the client has been mis-sold website hosting with their new website, as in &quot;your website needs to be hosted by us&quot;.</p>
<p>The web designer claims the client &quot;wants everything in one place&quot; but the way they have gone about doing this is completely the wrong way and opposite to what the client wants - let me explain.</p>
<p>When moving your website to a new host, first you set up the website and the DNS records on the new host, then once that has been done and the new website is ready to go live, you change the name servers on the domain name to point to the new host.</p>
<p>What the web designer did was ask the clients' IT support person (external company) to change the A record on the domain name - the A record points the domain name to a server, so he asked the IT person to change it to his servers IP address.</p>
<p>So what's wrong with that, well this means that if I delete the clients hosting package (once a customer moves their site, I delete their account as its no longer needed) on my server, this will delete all their DNS records, including their MS Exchange email DNS records, meaning the client would lose access to all their email accounts for the entire business (three locations) as soon as the DNS changes propagated.</p>
<p>I've had to keep their website account on my server running, while they get in touch with whoever manages the domain name, so they can change the name servers to point it to the web designers own hosting. But they are only doing this because I told them that if they don't they will have to continue paying me for hosting as well as the web designers own web hosting.</p>
<p>As it stands, the client now has DNS records hosted with me, the new website with the web designers own host and the domain name managed and hosted by someone else - what was that about the client wanting everything in one place.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's never nice to lose a client, I just don't like to see them get a worse deal. Since the client paid for a year of hosting, I have kept the hosting account running until they change the name servers which won't be done for a while as the IT person is now on holiday.</p>
<h3>Freelance Work</h3>
<p>Onto some good news - I have a potential new freelance client who needs a website for their Bed and Breakfast business - I'll be having an initial meeting with them soon - so I'll be sure to update you on how it goes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I have started to look for a new contract, but things are still not looking so good out there. There are contracts but mainly for React/JS Developers, not many for Interaction Designers or generalist Frontend Developers like myself.</p>
<p>Next step is for me to do my usual email blast to all the recruiters that have previously been in contact with me about contract work and let them know I'm available and looking for a new contract - stating my day rate and that I ideally would prefer a remote-only contract (fingers crossed).</p>
<h3>Home Office Improvements</h3>
<p>I've made some progress with the home office improvements. Two new purchases have been made - a new chair and a new mouse.</p>
<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/juanfernandes/q_auto,f_auto/v1596477696/home_office_desk_phjw5u.jpg" alt="Photo of my home office desk showing my monitor, macbook pro, desk lamp, keyboard and two computer mice.">
<p>I decided to buy the <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair" title="Autonomous Ergo Chair 2">Autonomous Ergo Chair 2</a> because it was cheaper than a Herman Miller Aeron, even a second hand one, The reason I purchased the cheaper (still expensive) chair was because at the moment, I'm still not getting fully remote contracts - I didn't want to spend about £500 on a chair I may only use two days a week.</p>
<p>Once all my contracts are fully remote, then I can assess the chair situation and see if I do indeed need an Aaron chair.</p>
<p>The Ergo Chair 2 didn't have as many recommendations as the Aeron, but it did come with some very good recommendations, including this one from Ben Frain - <a href="https://benfrain.com/review-autonomous-ergochair-2-office-chair/" title="Autonomous Ergo Chair 2 Review">read his detailed review of the Ergo Chair 2</a>. The chair is due to be shipped at the end of August.</p>
<p>My other purchase was the <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/mx-vertical-ergonomic-mouse" title="Logitech MX Vertical mouse">Logitech MX Vertical mouse</a>. I still have my MX Master - which is a very good mouse - but it's no longer helping with wrist pain, which it did for a long while.</p>
<p>The MX Vertical comes highly recommended from other developers who also suffer from wrist pain. I decided to buy it and give it a try for a bit and see how I get on with it.</p>
<p>It is taking some getting used to, as its a different shape to a standard mouse and your hand is in a different position. I'll see if it helps minimise my wrist pain. I'll continue using the MX Master for gaming - well playing Minecraft is the only gaming I do on my MacBook Pro, it's more comfortable to use it than the MX Vertical.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>This month my wife and I celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary, at home, with a three-course meal we prepared together. It was a very nice evening. We postponed our spa weekend trip for another year.</p>
<h3>Exercise and Fitness</h3>
<p>Well, I've surprised myself - I'm still doing the couch to 5k program. I've just finished the 7th week, which means only 2 weeks to go till I'm running 5k. Eek. 😬</p>
<p>But I've not been doing any other exercise in between running - but I'm not going to beat myself up about it and push my body too much and then end up not being able to do any exercise at all.</p>
<p>Once I complete the c25k program, I probably won't be running three times a week (but you never know), so I may be able to start doing some other type of exercise - probably a regular HiiT session as I found this to be a good way to lose some weight and gain fitness in the past.</p>
<p>With the running, I'm doing alright I think, at least during the runs themselves - I've not had stitches or split shins. But I have been getting some pain just under my knees the day after the run - I'm putting this down to my legs not being used to running.</p>
<p>That's it for July. How was you month?</p>

      <p>Wowsers, we are already halfway through the year and what a terrible year it has been. Hopefully, it will get better soon.</p>
<p>I hope you and your family are all well and coping in these strange times.</p>
<p>This months update has more personal than web design notes and this is because I've not done any web design work for a while now due to covid-19. Hopefully, this will change from next month once the kids finish school and I can then work on some side projects and hopefully get new contract.</p>
<h2>Health and Fitness</h2>
<p>After many failed attempts at getting fit, I'm trying something new - running!</p>
<p>Sort off, I have started the Couch to 5k program, so it's just light jogs - but it helps build up your stamina and improve fitness.</p>
<p>I'm doing that Monday Wednesday and Friday and then I do either a 15 min HIIT work out or yoga - this means I have Sunday as a rest day. I also doing some weights on run days.</p>
<p>In the past, I think I've tried to do too much at once - at the start of lockdown - I was doing weights, yoga and HIIT workouts and my body was not coping with it all.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this new training will help me get fitter.</p>
<h2>Podcasts</h2>
<p>Anyone else struggling to listen to podcasts now that they don't have to commute to work? I'm so behind on podcasts now. I tried listening to one whilst mowing the grass, but my cheap Bluetooth earphones died halfway through a podcast - they're ok earphones for now - they've been ok when running.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to podcasts. I can't listen to podcasts while working either. Would be good to hear how freelancers, that have been working from home for a while, before lockdown, have been listening to podcasts.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>All it takes is one vinyl and that's it - the vinyl buying bug returns. I've bought several 'new' vinyl over the last month to add to my eclectic vinyl collection.</p>
<p>Bought some dance and drum n bass tunes. I already have a load more vinyl in my Discogs basket! Tip: always check eBay for the same vinyl - sometimes you can find it cheaper there than on Discogs.</p>
<p>Are you on Discogs - find me on there as <a href="https://www.discogs.com/user/trulyjuan" title="trulyjuan on Discogs">trulyjuan</a></p>
<h2>Home Network Improvements</h2>
<p>Since lockdown started I've been doing a lot of #OneFixADay DIY fixes around the house and garden - and one project that I have done a lot on is my home network.</p>
<p>One of the main issues we have in our house is WiFi - it struggles to reach everywhere - but also, I had several access points throughout the house and this seemed to cause more issues than it sorted.</p>
<p>I also didn't like how we had bits of network kit all over the place - the router is in the living room because that is where the BT broadband comes into the house, I also have a switch there to connect the TV, PS4, surround sound, SkyTV box, Vera Edge Plus (home automation controller) and my pi-hole raspberry pi etc.</p>
<p>We also have network switches in other rooms to extend the network to other parts of the house and more access points.</p>
<p>So I bought and installed a small network cabinet in our cloakroom and have been installing network cables from different areas of the house (externally) - two cables from the living room - to move the BT broadband socket to the network cabinet and another for a network port for the switch to provide connectivity for the TV and the other equipment in the living room. Installed a new network cable to the office (loft above double garage) to replace the old one that had been chewed by mice and finally, I needed a new network cable to go into the kitchen, via the loft, from the network cabinet - this is so I can connect a switch to it, above the kitchen cupboards so I can connect my Sonos speakers to it. This was needed because the WiFi signal to the speakers gets interrupted a lot, especially when we use the microwave, which cuts off the music.</p>
<p>To fix the WiFi throughout the house, I also installed a new WiFi access point and removed all the old ones. I installed a <a href="https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-wireless/products/unifi-ap6-professional" title="Ubiquiti UniFi AP AC-PRO">Ubiquiti UniFi AP AC-PRO</a>, this covers the downstairs but I may need one to improve the WiFi signal upstairs.</p>
<h2>Selling stuff on eBay</h2>
<p>One positive thing to come out of being in lockdown has been the opportunity to work on clearing out our garage and selling a whole bunch of things we no longer needed. It's been good to finally make a start on clearing the garage, but also to know that these things I've sold have been given a new lease of life, rather than ending up at the refuse centre.</p>
<h2>Improving my home office</h2>
<p>I think remote work is going to become the new normal for me - so its time to work on improving my home office if I'm going to be working from home more than two days a week, which is normally the most I get when I have contract work.</p>
<p>First thing I've started is doing a big tidy up and clean.</p>
<p>Since I only ever usually work from home a couple of days a week, my office had sort of become a bit untidy. Lots of things from the house had made its way into my office.</p>
<p>Also, since I'm hardly ever in my office and always working in clients' offices, the office had been gathering dust and become a home for spiders too.</p>
<p>I've now started looking at how to make the office feel a lot nicer, more homely - rather than just a room above the garage. I'm thinking about giving the walls and ceiling a new coat of paint, fill in the holes and maybe even a feature wall behind my desk.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>I'm also looking into getting a new monitor - my current one is a 21&quot; Samsung that was given to me for free when I left my last permanent role about 6 years ago! It's not a great monitor - I need something that is a lot sharper and can show nice and crisp fonts on the screen so I can read code without having to lean forward to get closer to the screen - which is terrible for my posture.</p>
<p>Also, considering on getting a much better chair - currently looking at a refurbished Aeron as it been recommended by loads of people or an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair" title="Autonomous ErgoChair 2">Autonomous ErgoChair 2</a>. There is a big price difference between those two - but I will be getting one to replace my £150 (a previous version of the MARKUS) chair I got from Ikea about five years ago - now £150 for me was not what I would have considered a cheap chair but now that I have been using it a lot more - I've realised its not a great chair for my posture - it does look nice though!</p>
<p>Finally, I got a new desk mat - it goes under the keyboard and mouse and leaves plenty of room either side. My old mat was a third of the size and the mouse kept hitting the edge of it and it was very annoying. I use these to dampen the sound from my mechanical keyboard.</p>
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>I bought the <a href="https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch/" title="Eleventy from Scratch">Eleventy from Scratch</a> course by Andy Bell - I've only done a few lessons so far, but it's very well written and full of knowledge bombs - I've already learnt new things.</p>
<p>I'm fairly new to 11ty - I have only built one website (this one) with it, so when I saw Andy was building a course for it, I bought the course, and to my surprise, it's not just about 11ty, it covers a lot about web design - so its a great refresher.</p>
<p>I'm planning on using what I build as part of the course, as my 11ty starter framework for future websites.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Not much happening on the work front at the moment - since lockdown I've not been able to work because I've been homeschooling our children - whilst my wife has had to go back to teaching in school.</p>
<p>I have, however, as I've said previously, been working on a new website for a friends' martial arts club - I'll be getting that finished in July.</p>
<p>And just at the end of June - I have gained a new web hosting client via a recommendation by another client - they have had a bit of trouble with the current host.</p>
<p>They have said they want a new website design and a new Content Management System that is easier to use than WordPress. It could turn out to be my third 11ty based website.</p>
<p>That's all for this months update and thanks for staying with me until the end.</p>
<p>Once I'm back to working on web design stuff these updates will get less personal and more about work.</p>

      <p>I've been wanting to get back into recording gameplay, going to restart my Minecraft Let's Play series - but last time I did this, I was using a Toshiba laptop running on Ubuntu Linux.</p>
<p>So I've been reconfiguring OBS and working out the best screen size and testing sound... and for some reason, OBS was not recording the game sounds, it said Desktop Audio is disabled.</p>
<p>After a few searches, I came across an article that explained how to solve this issue - turns out you need another piece of software, iShowU, to be able to capture the sounds from one app to another!</p>
<p>Here is the guide I followed - <em>How to capture Mac desktop audio with OBS</em> - but this has been deleted.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>I've now been in lockdown for about sixty days and I'm struggling with lack of routine and schedule. As much as I try to stick to a schedule, it's hard, with everyone at home all the time - their routines and schedules get in the way of mine. Having to also be the head chef and head dishwasher, cooking for six people every evening, has taken its toll. But we are ok, we are all well and staying home, apart from my wife who does our weekly shop as well as having to go to work at school every 4th week.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I've designed a new website for a friends' martial arts school and have started building it completely from scratch. His current website, which he has never used, has a site builder on his WordPress theme, but it's not great. It's not easy to use and it is not suitable for &quot;non-techy people&quot; as he puts it. So I offered to add the content to his site for him, but instead have decided to build him a new website.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've designed and built a website from scratch, so I thought, why not use this opportunity, whilst in lock-down and without contract work, to improve my jamstack skills.</p>
<p>Its going to be built using the <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" title="Eleventy Static Site Generator">11ty static site generator</a> and <a href="https://forestry.io/" title="Forestry.io">forestry.io</a> as the CMS. The design is now done and I've started coding the website.</p>
<p>I have also been working on my website, working through my <a href="https://gitlab.com/juanfernandes/juanfernandes-v2/-/issues" title="Link to GitLab issues list">issues on GitLab</a> and here are ones I've fixed over the last couple of months:</p>
<ul>
<li>switched from sass to CSS variables for colours</li>
<li>stop manifest.JSON from opening a new TLS connection</li>
<li>remove document.write</li>
<li>fix hero image paths</li>
<li>add service worker random cache variable</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Life has been a bit different the last few months, as I am sure it has been for everyone, but there have been some advantages, like spending more time with my family and also finally getting to tackle that ever-growing list of DIY jobs that I can only get to at weekends normally, but am always too tired to get to. I have also been enjoying time spent working in our garden.</p>
<p>Here are some highlights from those DIY fixes:</p>

<p><em>Another thing that has been on the todo list for a while. These tiles are so thick I didn't want to even attempt to drill into them</em></p>

<p><em>Network cabinet installed on the wall. That's the first stage of tidying up my home network</em></p>
<p>I haven't had to do much homeschooling as my wife, who is a primary school teacher, has been helping our kids with all their school work, but looks like I will be in charge from June once my wife goes back to teaching in school again. Up until now, she has been working from home three out of four weeks, and then in school the fourth week.</p>
<p>I'm still cooking all the dinners during the week - it has taken some effort getting used to cooking for six, every evening!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>Better late than never I guess? So March has been the longest Monday ever! I was in lockdown two weeks before the government told us to do so, just because I could work from home, so I did because I didn't want to risk going into a large open office. It's not how I thought working from home full time would be like.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>My contract at CMI was due to end on the 27th March and my new contract, going back to Signet, was due to start on the Monday, but unfortunately due to coronavirus, all contractors at Signet were cancelled and most of their tech team was furloughed as Signet had to close their high street stores.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to get a further three-week extension at CMI, so I have another week left there and then I will be jobless - like a lot of other contractors and freelancers.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not much happening on the freelance side of things, which was the plan. I do have a small amount of work to do for LeManoosh - working on the front end for a new section of the website.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>It has been an interesting few weeks for sure. There has been a lot of adjustment with all of us (6) being home all the time. Schedules have gone awry. I need to create a new schedule for me to keep me sane for however long this pandemic lasts. I'm going to need to include exercise in that schedule because all I've been doing is eating and drinking, a lot.</p>
<p>I hope you and your family are all well and keeping safe. See you on the other side.</p>

      <p>February was a good month for me as I released my first open-source project - a tiny thing I made - an eleventy shortcode for using cloudinary images in your markdown files.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Been quite a busy month for freelance work, but it's also my last freelance project as I've decided to stop doing freelance work. This is the first time mentioning this publicly, but I will write a blog post explaining this in more detail (I'm not going back to permanent work).</p>
<ul>
<li>Finished a redesign for a client website - a day nursery, its the first time I've designed a website for that industry and has been an opportunity to get a little creative</li>
<li>Whilst adding cloudinary to my website, I discovered &quot;auto image format&quot; which means cloudinary will serve the best image format for the browser being used, so for chrome, it will serve images as webp - improving my websites' performance</li>
<li>I've now removed the NetlifyCMS code from my website as I've fully switched over to Forestry.io CMS. I was running both of them in parallel whilst I finished setting up Forestry.</li>
<li>While setting up forestry and Cloudinary, I ran into an issue with images, I needed a way of inserting images from Cloudinary into my markdown files, so I ended up creating an eleventy shortcode for adding cloudinary images to markdown files. Which I then put on a public repo and shared it with the 11ty community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>My current contract is ending in March but I have been in talks with Signet (my previous contract) and they want me to come back and help them with their next project. This is great for me and it also means no break between contracts.😁</li>
<li>I've continued building modules for my clients new WordPress website within Beaver Builder - I've even built a mini-module builder within Beaver Builder itself - it is a series of options allowing the user to customise a generic content block. Some of the options are things like rounded corners, borders, background colour etc - but the user is limited to just saying If they want an option, but can't change any of the properties - for example, they can change the border-radius size.</li>
<li>The rest of my time is spent creating new pages, whilst using modules created by the agency and testing them, raising bugs and testing fixes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Continuing my deep dive into reviewing my privacy and what data I share, I have now deployed a pi-hole (a DNS sinkhole) at home and also set NextDNS as upstream servers for extra protection!</li>
<li>There are ways around being able to use Pi-hole with the BT hubs, but I didn't like it, so it was an opportunity to also remove the BT hub from my network, which I've replaced with a Draytek Vigor router</li>
</ul>

      <p>Replacing Google calendar has been one of the hardest apps/services to replace.</p>
<p>We use a shared Google calendar at home and I couldn't finding an app &amp; service combo that is affordable.</p>
<p>I looked at Fastmail to replace email &amp; calendar, but it's very expensive for a family of 6. I wish they did a family plan.</p>
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>I opted for a WebDAV shared calendar using NextCloud on a Digital Ocean droplet. I then installed the DavX app to synchronise with the calendar app on my phone.</p>
<p>I now need to replicate this setup on the other family members' phones.</p>
<p>But I still have to use the Google Calendar app on my phone because DavX doesn't sync with other calendar apps it seems, at least until I replace the Android OS.</p>

      <p>The next stage in my privacy control adventure is to setup Pi-hole at home. To do this I've had to buy a new router to replace the BT Home Hub because it doesn't let you change the DNS servers, which you need to do in order to point it at Pi-hole.</p>
<p>New router has now been setup and the BT Home Hub is being used just for WIFI.</p>
<p>Will be setting up the Pi-hole this weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pi-hole® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.&quot; - https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>January has been a surprisingly busy month - it's normally a bit quieter than this. My contract was extended until the end of March - it was supposed to be just a 6-week contract until mid-January, so I had lined up some freelance work to tide me over before starting a new contract.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>My contract with CMI was extended until the end of March - it was initially a 6-week contract to help out with day to day front-end work, but instead, I was tasked with helping out with the new website.</p>
<p>CMI hired an agency to build them a custom WordPress website backend, whilst the Digital team at CMI design and build the front-end. I started by setting up a local WordPress development environment so we could start building components to be used by Beaver Builder - their chosen WordPress page builder.</p>
<p>I've not done much WordPress work in the past, but it seems I'll be doing a lot more of it now.</p>
<p>I had never set up a development environment for working with WordPress locally - there are quite a few options and I tried a few of them, ideally, I would have used Docker, but I couldn't get it to work with how the agency setup WordPress and their theme builder tool of choice, so I ended up using MAMP - which works well enough.</p>
<p>Once, the agency finishes their work and we take over, we'll likely look at simplifying the setup so we can use Docker instead.</p>
<p>Most of the custom components are built now, so we've started creating pages and testing all the custom components built by us and the ones built by the agency.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've done some more WordPress work on the Lemanoosh.com website - working on a huge update to the company profile section - both front-end and admin section. More to come in February.</li>
<li>Also been helping out a backend developer with some front-end work for one of his clients in France. Bit of a rush on this one, so not entirely happy with the code produced, but now the deadline has been met, I can go back and refine some of the code I'm not happy with. Also, it used Elementor - so my second exposure to a page builder and I'm still not impressed.</li>
<li>I've now finished changing business bank accounts to RBS and closed the Santander account. Hopefully won't have to do this for a while. It's a long process making sure all services, direct debits and clients update and use the new bank account details; which meant keeping the old account open for a few months just in case.</li>
<li>Closing the Santander account was surprisingly easy; I thought they were going to try and persuade me to stay when they said I had to call them to get the account closed - but they didn't which was a pleasant surprise.</li>
<li>One of the reasons I wanted to use FreeAgent was their recurring invoices feature - after I finish setting these up, it will offload a huge admin task. Nearly there.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Finished moving my website from NetlifyCMS over to Forestry.io. NetlifyCMS is good but has a few bugs that meant it wasn't great, especially their lack of mobile/responsive support. It was very easy to switch over to Forestry.io due to the fact I was using Eleventy and Nunjucks templates.</li>
<li>There's been quite a few bug fixes closed and also went back to using Cloudinary for image hosting, I initially removed it when I was getting rid of PHP and PerchCMS on my site, as it was easier. Took a while to get this working properly as the Cloudinary service on Forestry is still in beta. I think this is now working - after a few test posts without images!</li>
<li>I've also been tinkering with Photo and Notes posts - again I think these are both working properly now - finger crossed.</li>
<li>January also saw the return of the New Adventures conference in Nottingham - it was different in a good way and still a great conference - so much information to take away and process.</li>
<li>One of those takeaways was Laura Kalbags' talk on privacy, which has spurred another deep dive look into my privacy and apps/services that I use and thus hand over data to. I've been tweeting about this and will write a blog post as well. So far the hardest service to replace is the Google Calendar, I'm struggling to find a good alternative that allows sharing of a calendar with family members and doesn't cost a fortune!</li>

      <p>November saw the end of my contract at Signet and the start of a new contract at the <a href="https://www.managers.org.uk" title="Chartered Management Institute (CMI)">Chartered Management Institute (CMI)</a>. I have worked with them before and they asked to come back to help them with a new project.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Last week of November saw me starting a new contract with a company I have previously worked with. This is a first for me in the 4 and a bit years I've been contracting - that I've been asked to return to a company. They had been trying to get me back for a few months, but every time they got in touch, my contract at the time had been extended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm helping CMI with their new website. They have a custom Wordpress theme and backend being developed by an agency - myself and the in-house junior front-end developer, Harry, will be building components, or modules as they are known in Beaver Builder. We need to get as many done ASAP so that each department can start adding their content.</p>

<p>It has not been a smooth start, to be honest, I was expecting, based on the tight deadlines, that I'd be jumping straight in and be building components from the get-go, but unfortunately, they didn't even have access to the new website codebase, let alone a local development environment to allow them to run the custom Wordpress theme and be able to build new components. So that was my first task, not being a Wordpress developer, this was a first for me - but I like a challenge. More on this next month.</p>

<h2>Freelance</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Started doing some freelance work for the <a href="https://lemanoosh.com/" title="LeManoosh">LeManoosh</a> website - they needed a helping hand with some front-end fixes and we'll be working on updates as well soon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also did some work for a day nursery - a new client - they have an existing website that uses Joomla as their CMS. They needed help adding a new page and updating content to reflect their third nursery that opened in September.  We ended up having to move the website because it was still being hosted by the original web designer on their personal server and we couldn't get access to the backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sadly I lost a client this month as well. I can't say much about it right now, I'm not 100% sure why they decided to abandon their existing website, which was designed by someone else and I added a CMS when I came on board, but they have decided to get a new website with a different company.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>I struggled to keep up with writing weekly notes since I cut my days at the office down to just three, this meant I had less time to write and they also started to feel a bit repetitive every week and I didn't have much to write - so I am now trying monthly notes. We'll see how I get on with this schedule.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>October 31st was supposed to be my last day at Signet Jewelers but my contract was extended by another week, so I'll be the only contract front end developer left in the team, the other two finished on the 31st. I had already lined up some client work, so had to push that forward a bit.</p>
<p>The new Product List Pages (PLP) and Product Display Pages (PDP) for both brands (H. Samuel and Ernest Jones) went live at the end of October - this was a huge project that we had to get done in a very short amount of time, but we managed to get it out of the door in time.</p>
<p>We did have to make a few compromises here and there, not all the features that the designers created were implemented due to time constraints and complexities in the requirements.</p>
<p>Overall we achieved a lot and everyone is impressed with the new pages. I used a mixture of flexbox and CSS Grid layout throughout the H. Samuel product display page which led to bug fixing some IE and Edge layout issues caused by using CSS grid - but to be honest, nothing major. Mostly due to IE not being able to deal with auto-placement, so for IE we had to be more specific.</p>
<p>I loved using flexbox - first time using it a lot in one project - I couldn't understand why some of the other front end developers were still using floats!</p>
<p>Now that I have an extra week at Signet after this huge project, I've started refactoring some of the components to improve on a few things that were missed and also get rid of those floats in favour of flexbox.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Earlier in the month, I met with a new client. They have an existing website, but they need some changes. They are a children's nursery, with 2 locations and are about to open a third. We have identified some initial work to get the third location up and running.</p>
<p>I now need to do a project proposal for the main work - redesign the website to better incorporate multiple locations, give them a fresh new design and a CMS that is easier for them to edit and add new content to their website.</p>
<p>The plan for the initial work was for me to get admin access and create a new page for the new nursery, at the same time making the groundwork for the new website structure, but the client didn't have access to the admin side of the website, the previous web designer still had and was also still hosting the site for free on his server.</p>
<p>The client decided they would like to move the website and get it hosted properly. I got sent the website and database and I set up the new hosting account within my Guru reseller account, uploaded the website and re-created the database, changed the config to connect to the new database.</p>
<p>But the previous designer couldn't remember the administrator password, so after some research, I was able to delve into the database and change the password for the super administrator account. Next step is to get the domain name servers pointing to the new host. Then the work can begin.</p>
<h3>Business</h3>
<p>I decided earlier in the year that I'd be switching business bank accounts. So this month I was able to move away from Santander to RBS. I didn't have any issues with Santander, they have been fine and would still recommend them - they were the only bank that allowed you to open a business bank account on the same day without visiting a branch back in 2015 when I set up my limited company.</p>
<p>But ever since then, I've used spreadsheets for my accounts and custom invoicing software - more recently I tried InvoiceNinja.com but it all still felt a bit all over the place. I've always wanted to use FreeAgent, but I wasn't happy paying all that money for something I had been able to do for free. (You do get a lot for your money, but I wouldn't be using all those features.)</p>
<p>Then I saw that you can get a free FreeAgent account if you open a Natwest or RBS business bank account so I decided to change business bank accounts to RBS. Not only do I get FreeAgent for free but I also save £2.50 a month on banking fees - yay!</p>
<p>This month was spent changing all my direct debits and changing my card details on a few websites, as well as switching to using FreeAgent to send invoices to clients and making sure they updated my new bank account on their records.</p>
<p>This month sees me getting two new clients, one of which will also be a new hosting client and am hosting a new website for an existing hosting client. Its been a while since I've taken on new hosting clients/websites.</p>
<p>Finally, spent some time researching into getting some sort of private pension setup. I haven't been paying into one since I started working for my self - apart from the state pension (which I don't expect it to amount to much).</p>
<p>Anyway, researching into setting up a private pension is a nightmare - unless you just want a traditional pension, that's easy - <a href="https://www.pensionbee.com" title="PensionBee">PensionBee</a> looks great, but everything I read says you should set up a SIPP which is a Self-invested personal pension. So far the only decision I have made is that I am going to set up a <a href="https://www.youinvest.co.uk/lifetime-isa" title="LISA (Lifetime ISA) with AJ Bell YouInvest">LISA (Lifetime ISA) with AJ Bell YouInvest</a>.</p>
<p>Once I have decided and set it all up, I will write a blog post about it.</p>
<p>That's it for October - until next month. Enjoy the autumn weather.</p>

      <p>Not a lot to write about this week. Still really busy with my current contract - busy is good. But obviously its harder to keep up with note-taking in preparation for writing these.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>After the header work for H. Samuel (HS) I moved onto working on the new Product Detail Page (PDP) for the same brand and I have made great progress.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing about the current project is the time we don't have to work on it, due to dev cut off at the end of October and redesigning and rebuilding two PDP is a big task. So it's only natural that some things got missed for one reason or another.</p>
<p>I've mainly been restyling and in some instances rewriting the HTML for the components that my colleagues have built for the Ernest Jones PDP. The great thing about the brands having to look different is that the designers changed the layouts of some of the HS components and I've had great fun working with CSS grid layout and Flexbox to achieve these layout changes.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Potentially secured some freelance work from a new client and I have a meeting scheduled with them coming up soon. I haven't been actively searching for freelance work, but this client was referred to me.</p>
<h2>Thinking</h2>
<p>I've been thinking recently about whether I want to carry on doing contract work or freelance - why? Mainly due to wanting to work remotely and also being my own boss.</p>
<p>But speaking with a friend and fellow contractor has popped that bubble. He says freelance work is harder to find than contract work, harder as a solo person and can be more stressful. Maybe not popped the bubble yet, but sort of deflated it a bit.</p>
<p>The side project itch has resurfaced again and I've been thinking about what to create - hopefully something that will generate some passive income.</p>

      <p>As my current contract gets busier and we head towards a huge deadline, I'm a lot more tired in the evenings, so the last thing I want to do when I get to the hotel and get back on my computer and do some work or write a blog post.</p>
<p>Thinking about moving these to 'quarterlies' instead. Attempting to schedule writing these on the weekends to see if I can continue with the weeknotes, if not I'll try quarterlies as I may have more to write as well.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Busy last few weeks as I worked on the new header for H. Samuel, which was released last week.</p>
<p>I am now working from home 2 days a week, Mondays and Fridays which makes a huge difference to my well being and family life. Also, means less money spent on hotels and food while away.</p>
<p>Moved onto the next project - the redesign of the H. Samuel product page. The team has been working on the Ernest Jones version while I worked on the H. Samuel header.</p>
<p>My contract has been extended until the end of October now and will potentially extend to a few days a week in November which is great.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>I've not had any freelance work to do for a while now, which makes sense, because I'm not actively looking for any and I have a 'full time' contract at the moment. But I have been chasing a customer since April to get them to complete a few tasks so that I can finish the project. I finished the development of the project back in April and it was sent over to them to test and complete the products list spreadsheet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I will be able to get another contract before the end of the year, with my current contract talking about having me back for a couple of days a week working remotely in November, I thought it might be a good idea to line up some freelance work for November and December that way I can finish the year working from home.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Nothing much happening right now. Been prepping the house and garden ready for winter - boring things like making sure the gutters are clear and putting stuff away.</p>
<p>I haven't worked on my website since the new version went live - just been too busy at work - when I get back to the hotel I'm just too tired to get back on the computer.</p>
<p>I'm trying to get into the habit of posting tweets via my website, so that I own the content since my posts auto-post to twitter. The only thing I need to work out is how to get them to post to other networks now, like Mastodon.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>It's apparent that when I get busy at work, I don't read as much.</p>

      <p>This weeknotes has been in my drafts for a few weeks now. It only takes getting busy at work, for writing weeknotes to fall off the radar. I need to find a way of fitting this into my routine.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>The new version of this website is live, it has been rebuilt using a static site generator, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>. It's the same design with minor tweaks, but this update was mainly about the underlying structure - moving away from PHP and PerchCMS to Nunjucks and <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">NetlifyCMS</a>, as well as hosting it on <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a>.</p>
<p>I had to manually copy over all my blog posts and notes as I couldn't figure out a way to export them from Perch. It wasn't too bad as I didn't have that many blog posts. The plan was to convert the RSS feed to static HTML and then use that as the start for the new static site pages - that's when I realised my RSS feed wasn't showing full page content, just the excerpt but I couldn't get the PHP template to output the full content in the end.</p>
<p>The last few weeks leading up to the release of the website I was doing a lot of minor fixes to get the site ready to go live - this meant I didn't have any spare time to write on my blog.</p>
<p>I had to figure out a few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Netlify redirects - figured out how to do redirects in the end</li>
<li>Amp redirects - got rid of amp articles from my site - I only implemented this to figure out how to do them with Perch in case a customer asked for them</li>
<li>Netlify form gotchas - added honeypot, but forgot to add the netlify specific data attribute to the <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> itself, also helps if the form action is called <code>action=</code> - for some reason I had it set to <code>path=</code></li>
<li>If you've added content to your site on Netlify, via NetlifyCMS before you added a custom domain, you won't be able to log into NetlifyCMS until you republish your website - see <a href="https://community.netlify.com/t/netlifycms-on-custom-domain/2808/2?u=juanfernandes">https://community.netlify.com/t/netlifycms-on-custom-domain/2808/2?u=juanfernandes</a></li>
<li>Had some fun figuring out how to move my site to Netlify but keep email hosting with my host, Guru - got there in the end with some help from <a href="https://my.guru.co.uk/aff.php?aff=6526">Guru</a> support.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I've been working on the rebuild of my website I have been following a proper git workflow, as in having issues in <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a>, creating a branch for that issue, working on it and then merging that to master - instead of working directly on master, as I have done in the past with personal projects.</p>
<p>Now that my site gets published automatically via GIT and Netlify, and the site is live, I'm changing my git workflow a bit to include a develop branch. I will take new feature branches from develop, then merge them back to develop.</p>
<p>Posting via NetlifyCMS builds my site from master which means it automatically deploys it, anything else, like code changes, will get merged into develop first, create a preview and then will get merged into master for the weekly releases.</p>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>I have a bunch of design issues in Gitlab that I will working my way through. Again, the design won't change much, but I want to remove my custom grid and start using CSS Grid Layout and also Flexbox to improve my layouts.</p>
<p>I really need to nail down a routine for creating more content on here, especially blog posts as I haven't published any for a while. I also want to get back to posting weekly notes.</p>

      <h2>Work</h2>
<p>Work on the new header continues for one of the brands and the pressure is on to get it finished within this sprint.</p>
<p>This week we created a new branch to merge all the separate branches. Since two developers have been building different components for the header, we needed to start bringing in those components into one branch to start forming the header.</p>
<p>We did it this way because we didn't want to merge our new components into our development branch in case we don't get the work finished and tested on time.</p>
<p>There are quite a few moving parts with this piece of work and its a big part of the website. Front-end, back-end and the product teams all have work to do to get this live.</p>
<p>To add further complication - because both brands share the same HTML code - but different styling, the backend team have to build a 'switch' that will check whether a brand gets the new header or the old one since we're only building one at a time.</p>
<p>Also, as part of the new header, the navigation items are now going to be controlled via the CMS by the product teams - so this has to be populated manually in each environment and must be completed before we can go live with it.</p>
<p>Working on components in an isolated way is great, but then, when they have to come together, there's going to be some issues as they are integrated, especially with all of them being part of the header and they have to be 'aware of each other. For example. When a user clicks the menu icon, we activate an overlay and show the menu, but we also have to check if the search component is open, if it is, it needs to be closed. What if the user has the menu (and overlay) open and then they click the search icon to open the search component - we need to <em>not</em> hide the overlay, but close the menu. What seems like a simple design, can start to get complicated when you have so many moving parts.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Continued working on my website - mainly working on the blog. I added the <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/" title="Netlify CMS">Netlify CMS</a> to my site and have started adding my old blog posts to it via the Netlify CMS interface.</p>
<p>I looked into changing my current RSS feed so it shows the entire post, as opposed to just an excerpt but I couldn't get it to work, so I'm just manually copying the posts from my current CMS and into Netlify CMS.</p>
<p>I've fixed some of the metadata issues and its working, but I do need to look at this in more detail as its a bit clunky. I need to take it out of the layout template and include it as a partial so it's easier to work with it in base and blog layouts.</p>
<p>I also decided to move my notes out of the blog and into its own section. So on the new site, weeknotes and other notes will live in <code>/notes</code> and not in <code>/blog</code>. I did this because, to separate posts from notes, I tagged posts with a <code>post</code> tag but this meant that when I show the post tags at the end of each blog post, it was showing <code>post</code> which was pointless.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the issues I'm working through:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>This week I set up a Discord server so I can chat with my kids while we play on our Minecraft server during the summer holidays while I'm away for work. It will be mainly with my son, who is really into it - so I got him a headset and he loves it :D</p>
<p>We have a new family car, and it's a nice one, that we want to keep for a long time and since its a nice car, we decided it would be a good idea to install a dashcam. There are so many reckless drivers on the roads, we don't want to take any chances with insurance companies!</p>
<p>Felt wrong loosening the interior panels to hide the cables for the dashcam. I have a couple of issues I need to solve; the power lead is not long enough for our car because the cigarette lighter socket is near the back of the centre console and also the rear camera is causing interference with the radio.</p>
<p>I'm going to replace the cigarette lighter power cable with a longer USB cable and get a USB cigarette lighter adapter. With the interference I need to look into what is causing this - I think I need to connect the cable to earth/ground point.</p>
<p><em>Anyway, that's enough from me. How was your week?</em></p>

      <p>After a bit of an unscheduled break, my weeknotes are back. You may notice that weeknotes are no longer showing on the blog index - after some feedback, I decided it didn't make sense to clutter the blog with notes. They have taken over because I've not been writing much of anything else.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I've been busy building components for the new header for one of the brands. I've been creating the new search component. Just working on the HTML, SCSS and some JavaScript - but I'm going to need some help from the team to improve my JS.</p>
<p>I'm not writing the code for the actual searching and returning results, we'll be using the existing code for that.</p>
<p>The trickiest thing - for me at least, with building the search component is how it behaves on mobile when a user scrolls the page. The expected behaviour will be that when the site first loads, the search component will be visible, but then hides when the user scrolls the page up and shows again when the user scrolls down.</p>
<p>I've added this now, but the main concern is how it will affect the site performance, as I have to watch for a scroll action, currently without any delay - so I need to add some kind of delay or X amount of pixels to scroll before it shows the search component again.</p>
<p>I've now moved onto creating the new header - including a new menu button, search icon, user login/logout, store locator link and basket with item count. There are some unique things with the design, that makes it a little bit more complicated to build - there are some changes between mobile and desktop but it will retain the burger menu - the main difference the search component - on desktop it will be hidden and shown with a search icon, revealing it under the header - it looks nice and clean.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>I've been quite productive on the rebuild of this website. As I have mentioned before, my current side project is rebuilding this website using a static site generator, 11ty and moving away from PHP and Perch - purely for wanting to learn new technologies and further my skills.</p>
<p>A few highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed all links to cloudinary, since Netlify provides all the same features that I currently use, there is no need to use both</li>
<li>finished converting the blog index, post and archive templates into Nunjucks and now am able to turn markdown blog posts into HTML pages</li>
<li>removed the social media sharing component from the blog posts template - this was a basic HTML component that allowed users to click on a social network icon and share the post to network - but I'm pretty sure no one uses these things and I've read a few articles in the past that say the same - so out with the clutter</li>
<li>removed category links from the sidebar throughout the blog - they are being replaced by blog post tags, which will be at the end of each post</li>
<li>recreated my RSS feed and now because of 11ty, it's much easier to create specific feeds for each category - this will allow users to subscribe to all blogs posts, including notes or just notes, or blog posts about design or development etc</li>
<li>started setting up the Netlify CMS config file and I plan to document the process into a blog post</li>

      <p>I'm sounding like a broken record, but it has been yet another slow week at work. We're still having some GIT related issues - not me personally, and we're also completely redoing our build process so that has caused some expected issues.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>This week I decided to set up <a href="https://gnupg.org/" title="Gnu Privary Guard">GPG</a> to sign my GIT commits - just because I saw a talk about it by <a href="https://twitter.com/ric__harvey" title="Ric Harvey on Twitter">Ric Harvey</a> at the <a href="https://colchesterdigital.org.uk/conference/" title="Colchester Digital Conference">Colchester Digital conference</a>. Someone at work asked me why I go through the hassle of setting this up; I said that by spending my spare time doing something like this - next time I get a contract that requires me to sign my git commits, I'll either be ready to do with my own laptop or at least know how to get it set up on a new machine.</p>
<p>So, setting up GPG itself on my MacBook Pro was fairly easy - but where I ran into issues was using it with <a href="https://fishshell.com/" title="Fish Shell">Fish shell</a> - which I'm still learning more about as I haven't been using it for that long.</p>
<p>I was getting the following error <code>failed to write commit object</code>; to fix this I needed to export the GPG TTY  in my <code>fish.config</code> file:</p>
<p><code>set -x GPG_TTY (tty)</code></p>
<p>Easy right! Took quite a few hours of searching and trying different things to get to that fix, once I realised it was working in Terminal and it didn't work using Fish shell.</p>
<p>I have now cancelled my Reseller account and can say goodbye to Heart Internet - finally. I've not been happy with them for the last few years as their service deteriated as well as their customer support, plus they are now owned by GoDaddy! I was a customer of theirs for over 10 years.</p>
<p>Spent a couple of hours fixing things that had broken as part of the move away from them including HTTPs issues with my friends WordPress website and I also fixed some of their CSS issues - which were being caused by the theme having hardcoded image links.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that I spent a few days writing a cover letter and answering a bunch of questions for a permanent job application - well I heard back and unfortunately, I didn't get an interview. It was expected really, they are an awesome and well-known company, had loads of applications and I knew that I didn't have all the required skills they wanted, but it was good to spend that time thinking about why I want to go back to permanent work.</p>
<p>I'm still not 100% sure if going back to permanent is for me, not yet anyway, I still feel as though freelance work, not contract, would be better for me - but that trouble with freelance, at least for me is that it has always been very much 'feast or famine' and that's not great when you have a mortgage and bills to pay, as well as a family to support. I plan on writing a blog post about 'Permanent vs Freelance vs. Contract' work, to hopefully help me work out what is the best route for me.</p>

      <p>Bit of a slow week at work while we wait for the new UX Designer to get acquainted with the business and produce some designs for the Front-end Developers to produce.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>This week my main focus was on creating a 'getting started' guide on creating a new component within our Fractal based component library. Got that finished and ready for review. It's interesting how much you forget about when it's not documented, even though the process here is new to me.</p>
<p>Spent some time teaching some of the other developers how to use GIT via the command line, in this case, GIT Bash. Most of the developers here have never used GIT and they started using recently after switching from SVN - but they started using it via their IDEs which has led to a mixture of issues.</p>
<p>Things like working on the wrong branch because they thought their IDE has switched to the feature branch but it hadn't and they committed their changes into the develop branch and UI elements saying things like <em>Merge</em> when it means <em>Pull</em> etc.</p>
<p>So we've decided it will be easier if they all know some basic commands because they all have different IDEs and everyone is in agreement with this change. I think if the command line had been introduced first, they may have been scared to use it, but having seen how many issues they have had with their IDEs and their GIT UIs and then seeing myself and the other contractor hop over, jump on the command line and fix the issues with ease - they are now not afraid of the command line.</p>
<p>I also learnt some new GIT things this week. I learned that you can rename a branch, local and remote using the following command will rename the local branch you are currently in:
<code>git branch -m new-name</code></p>
<p>And I created myself a new alias:
<code>alias use-the-force=git push --force-with-lease</code></p>
<p>With some many developers merging into <code>develop</code> I found I have to rebase quite a lot and so I got fed up of type <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> every time and decided it was time I <em>Used the force</em> 😬</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>This week in freelance has mainly consisted of admin work and moving the last few websites and domain names away from Heart Internet.</p>
<h3>Domain names and website hosting</h3>
<p>Over the past year, I've been migrating 44 websites - some simple, other database and CMS based one and it has been painful. Mainly because of not having enough time to focus on this while doing freelance and contract work, so I let this task slip.</p>
<p>But finally, the last 3 websites were dealt with. One was deleted as the client no longer needs it as they focus on other ventures, another had to be transferred to Heart Internet 💩 - because it guaranteed no downtime and not extra IT resources on my clients' side, so my client chose to stay with Heart Internet. I helped by creating a new account with Heart Internet and initiated the support request to get it migrated from my account to theirs.</p>
<p>Another, <a href="https://www.thewebsiteofdoom.com" title="The Website of Doom!">thewebsiteofdoom.com</a> was also going to get deleted, but one the contributors decided to keep it going and has taken on the hosting costs, so had to get it moved over to my new hosts, <a href="https://my.guru.co.uk/aff.php?aff=6526" title="Guru.co.uk - affliliate link">Guru 💰</a> and managed to get some initial issues fixed - I hate WordPress websites! (I'm still fixing a few issues with it, doesn't help that I didn't build it).</p>
<h3>Simplifying my business</h3>
<p>I cancelled my renewal of <a href="https://www.InvoiceNinja.com" title="Invoice Ninja">InvoiceNinja.com</a> as I decided to move to FreeAgent because I got it for free (I'm also switching business bank accounts, that's how I got FA for free). So that's a bit of saving but getting rid of another yearly subscription as I continue to simplify things with my business.</p>
<p>It turns out, that after years of logging expenses in a spreadsheet and taking photos of my expenses receipts using an app was a waste of time because you only need to log them if you're claiming those expenses back, but since I use a business card and not my own bank card, I don't claim expenses and I only need to keep the receipts!</p>
<h3>Client work</h3>
<p>Didn't do much client work this week, other than tidying up an export of the members from a clients website. They have 'free membership' on their website currently, but as part of the shop project I've been working on for them, they will be selling memberships.</p>
<p>So we need to remove all current members (not very active) and we will be emailing them (we have their consent for this, don't worry) to let them know about the changes to membership and invite them to join again if they want.</p>
<p>This was a very manual process as I couldn't find a way to print out the full list of members, so I exported the table from the database into a CSV file and cleaned it up in Excel. 🤷</p>
<p>That's it for this week. Do let me know if you're reading this and are enjoying it or not - you send me a tweet or DM me over on <a href="https://twitter.com/juanfernandes" title="Juan Fernandes on Twitter">Twitter</a></p>

      <p>Another bank holiday week but it was a very busy weekend. Second week at my new contract. I'm really getting behind on week notes, so this week I have published two in order to keep up to date.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>It was my second week at my new contract and it was a busy one. There were quite a few GIT related issues - even I had some. I wasn't able to push a brand up to the repo after I had rebased it, couldn't work out why then I remembered you're supposed to <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> if the branch already exists in the remote repo.</p>
<p>We've found that some of the developers IDEs where doing unexpected things when they were running git commands. One of the reasons why I prefer to use the command line for GIT is because at least if it goes wrong, I know what I did - with a UI, that's not always the case.</p>
<p>This was also the first time we've done a deployment to pre-production using the new workflow with GIT and an automated build pipeline.</p>
<p>I also spent some time studying CSS Grid and how it is being used on their website and I collected a load of notes ready to write some documentation on the process of adding new components to the component library.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>What a busy weekend (another bank holiday) and this one was busy because we had a Fete in my village in Suffolk. I'm a Bawdsey Hall and Recreation Ground committee member - this means we look after those and also raise money for their upkeep. Every year we have a Fete and I help with setting up the tents and the tannoys and then run a stall and stay behind afterwards to put everything away.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon I was at a neighbours birthday party, had a few pints and then had to go over to the recreation ground to help with putting the frames for the tents together - I'm so glad we had quite a few helpers this year!</p>
<p>Then, Monday - I was back on the field from 7 am to help set up the tannoys, then finished setting up the tents - again lots of helpers came back, so I mostly had to just walk around making sure they were being put together properly - these are very old tents and have had many 'modifications' over the year and people like to use mallets to force things together! Finished at 7 pm and had done over 20k steps.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my last post, I've been thinking a lot about my current work situation - I've been pondering this for a while now - but I finally came to the realisation that maybe its time to start looking at going back to permanent work.</p>
<p>I have applied for my first permanent job - it's for a company I've kept an eye on for a while now, but until recently they didn't consider remote workers, but now they do. It took me about a week to finish the application, I spent time writing a cover letter - something I've never bothered with before and I also spent some time answering their application questions.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a stretch - it's a Web Engineer position, which is not a job title I'd normally give myself, but the way the job was described, I feel I have a lot of transferrable skills that can be applied to that position. I'll let you know how I get on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I will continue with my current contract and will look to get a remote contract after this one.</p>
<p>I won't be just applying to every remote permanent job that I come across - I want to take my time and focus on finding a great fit with a company before applying. I've always struggled at permanent jobs because I hate office politics and companies that don't treat you like adults or companies that just hire &quot;cogs for their machine&quot;.</p>

      <p>Started a new contract on Monday, working for Signet Jewellers aka H.Samuel and Ernest Jones based in Borehamwood, North London. It was a hell of a drive, but as usual, I drive to work Monday morning and then stay in the area until I drive back on Fridays.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Spent the first few days setting up my work PC and Dev environment - back to using Windows Windows (yuck!).  They use a lot of Microsoft products, so it makes sense for them to be on Windows.</p>
<p>Took a while to get my machine up and running because the team is currently in the process of switching from SVN to GIT - so they're making changes to how they work and how their local development environment needs to be set up. We're just waiting for the deployment pipeline now.</p>
<p>Really interesting to see the struggle that some of these long-time SVN users went through as they changed to GIT. I vaguely remember using SVN, briefly, and I remember hating it and losing work, but I guess it's a mindset thing they need to adjust.</p>
<p>It's going to take a while for me to get used to all this traffic - London really busy and full of cars. From next week I will be leaving my car at the hotel for the day, so won't need to drive to work. This week I stayed in an Airbnb 10m drive away, but there's so much traffic that leaving at 7 am still took 30 mins and then I still needed to find a parking space!</p>
<p>I'm also back to using VS Code, not my choice, but because it integrates better with their Dev environment and the Azure infrastructure - I'll be using it for this contract. This may be something that will likely happen again, so I have saved my custom settings, plugins and themes.</p>
<p>I'll be using Gulp, Sass, Fractal and Handlebars for this contract. I'm glad I finally get to use Fractal - I've been wanting to try it for a while.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I've not had any time to work on my own website or my freelance project - this is mostly done and I'm just waiting for the client to do their first round of testing.</p>
<p>Bank holiday next week, which means a short week and also my villages yearly Fete, which I help with setting up!</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, I have been thinking about my work and how I'm not really happy with how things have been going - I'm not talking about code things, more the life of a travelling <s>salesperson</s> contract front-end developer!</p>

      <p>This weeknotes is late again due to having a weekend without being in front of a screen, most of it - my youngest child had been begging me to jump on the Minecraft server so we could play together. This week was my last with DXW and DfE (only 2 days) and the rest of the week was spent working on my own website and on my freelance project.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Very short week as I only worked two days - my last with the Department for Education as my replacement is now settled in and up to speed with the project.</p>
<p>Had the rest of the week off as my new contract starts next week.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Being off work meant I could do some more work on my own website as I convert it to a static site.</p>
<p>Got quite a few 'issues' closed this week which means my converted website is nearly ready to go live! The hardest thing about this project has been holding myself back on fixing <em>everything</em> - but I need to concentrate on getting all the pages converted from PHP to nunjucks and onto eleventy first.</p>
<p>This week I created a bunch of 301 redirects - nothing groundbreaking but just learning how to do these with Netlify. Finished converting existing work projects to nunjucks.</p>
<p>Updated the code on the contact form to use Netlify forms - because its a static website, there isn't PHP or anything else running on the server to process form submissions - so we'll use Netlify's magic for this.</p>
<h3>Video/stream</h3>
<p>I also decided that it was about time I tested the waters with recording myself coding and talking about what I was doing - I didn't quite have the confidence to do a live stream, so I opted to record it and then watch it back. There are a few things I need to improve - but overall it wasn't a bad first attempt.</p>
<p>Thanks to Ross <a href="https://twitter.com/magicroundabout" title="Ross on Twitter">@magicroundabout</a> for inspiring me to get on and do it, after watching his stream.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Nearly there with my e-commerce website project. The client has started to test the website and has started asking questions and has finally started putting together a list of products. Both of these, I needed them to have started a lot sooner, but this didn't happen.</p>
<p>This week I finished off quite a few minor, but important things. I added a way of showing product variations - think different sizes if the product was an item of clothing - the client may never need this, but I didn't want them to need it and it not being there for them to use.</p>
<p>Worked out how to pass a bit more information to Stripe, so that in the dashboard the client will have more information about the customer and the order.</p>
<p>As much as we all agree that image sliders are useless, I do think that they can be useful in some situations and having one on the product details page I believe makes sense.</p>
<p>Lastly, I added a login/register link to the header on all pages. One of the websites new features is to have paid members - so I needed a way to make it easier for members to log in wherever they landed on the website - but I didn't want to add another icon to the header and didn't want to add another menu item - as there are already too many.</p>
<p>So I decided to use add a links section above the header. If a member is already signed in, they will see a link to the members' area - where they have access to their digital purchases and other files.</p>

      <p>Not much happened this week. The handover process is well underway and there if not much left now to handover. It was my last full week in Manchester.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>This week was my last full week in Manchester working in the Department for Education offices with the dxw team.</p>
<p>I spent most of the week working with my replacement - Rich - on handing over all the bits and pieces I've worked on, creating some docs with access information. I also learnt how to transfer a heroku app from my own account to another.</p>
<p>Made some changes to the prototype while working with Rich and the service designer.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I've managed to get quite a few changes done to my personal website as I convert it to a static site. I converted my 404 page to nunjucks and also removed the jQuery dependency.</p>
<p>I had a list of companies I've worked for that is shown on the work page, but the last 4  get repeated on the homepage - I moved the list of companies into a JSON file and on the homepage, I only show the first 4 companies, while on the work page, it shows the entire list.</p>
<p>Had to figure out how to achieve this with nunchucks and I did it using the following code:</p>
<pre><code>  &lt;div class=&quot;four cols&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;client&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;client__logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/imgs/work/clients/ernest-jones-2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four cols&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;client&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;client__logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/imgs/work/clients/hsamuel-2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four cols&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;client&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;client__logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/imgs/work/clients/lusso-prestige-2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;four cols&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;client&quot;&gt;
      &lt;img class=&quot;client__logo&quot; src=&quot;/assets/imgs/work/clients/hoseasons-2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;```

I'm really enjoying this side project of converting my PHP CMS based website to a static site as well as working with Netlify - learning quite a few new things along the way. Hopefully next week I will hope on Twitch and do a bit of streaming - just to get used to talking about the code I'm writing.

      <p>This week started the handover process to my replacement at the Department for Education, as well as making a lot more progress to the prototype. Got a new contract lined up to start pretty much as soon as I finish my current one, which is a first and I have finally made nsome time to work on my own website.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Had a phone interview for a job I originally applied for some time in March. I hadn't heard back so just assumed they didn't want to see me, I then worked at Hoseasons and then the Department for Education - the recruiter was in touch last week to say they were still looking to hire but had delayed the hiring process until now.</p>
<p>So had the phone interview Wednesday morning (before work) and heard back from the recruiter on Thursday evening to say they'd like to offer me the 3-month contract. It's in Borehamwood, North London - so another new location for me and it means I will be staying away for the week during the contract again, but it close enough that I can drive there.</p>
<p>This is great news. I was hoping I'd get another interaction designer position within a government department but this contract sounds interesting. Will be working with a headless CMS which will be a first for me.</p>
<p>My replacement started on Wednesday and I've spent about half of my time showing them what's what and what I've been working on.</p>
<p>Really sucks to leave the project and team at a stage where we've now figured things out and we have a clear idea if what we need to deliver.</p>
<p>But I knew this was only a short (6 weeks) contact as they had already hired a full-time Interaction designer that would be starting in May.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Worked on my <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk" title="Personal website of Juan Fernandes">personal website</a> and setup on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" title="Netlify">Netlify</a> while I'm developing, had some issues with <code>ruby sass</code> and <code>grunt</code> and <code>package.json</code> build commands, fixed by upgrading to <code>node sass</code> - because ruby sass is quite old and has been deprecated on Netlify. I was having issues with getting Netlify to run grunt and eleventy to build my website,</p>
<p>Spent some time trying to get <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" title="Eleventy Static Site Generator">11ty</a>, <em>grunt</em> and watching changes to work and without installing another <em>npm</em> module - I don't believe it's possible. I've just settled for running iTerm split into 3 panes one running <code>eleventy --serve</code>, <code>grunt dev</code> (watch etc) and another for <em>git</em> etc.</p>
<p>Have started working on converting existing projects pages into nunjucks templates.</p>

      <p>Short week at work due to the bank holidays in the UK. First time working from home in this contract. I should really make some notes during the week to make writing weeknotes easier.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Last week was a short week at work due to the Easter bank holidays. I worked from home for the first time in this contract. Working from home is great when you have plenty of work to do, but I had quite a few meetings that week and not being in the office during those is hard.</p>
<p>Now that I have finished converting the alpha prototype from PHP to the GOVUK prototype kit - I can finally start working with the service designer to explore the policy in detail and really think about the questions we need to ask on the prototype, as it seems some of the criteria was not covered in the alpha prototype.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Its that stage in the project where I'm getting all the smaller tasks done. I also created a login/register page for new customers. I was originally going to use tabs on the page to show a login form on one tab and a registration form on another tab - but I decided this wasn't needed - it was a waste to put such a small login form taking up an entire page. I decided to send users to a login page, and then have a button for them to register, which takes them to another page - once they register, it takes them back to the checkout process.</p>
<p>Fixed a few bugs and also coded and styled the order successful page. I chose to show some information, like order status, total, order and invoice number, as well as listing the items they ordered. I also included a newsletter subscription module to encourage new customers to signup to the clients' newsletter.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>This week I started job hunting for my next contract. My current contract at the DfE is only a short one - six weeks, which is soon coming to an end. They have a full-time UX Designer starting soon, so they can't extend my contract - but I knew this when I took the contract.</p>
<p>I'm hoping my next contract is a remote one or one that is closer to home. I really miss my family and Suffolk when I'm away for work.</p>

      <p>Another short week notes this week due to a short week and a long bank holiday weekend that I spent with friends and family and no screens.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Spent another full week in Manchester working on with the Department for Education. Finished converting an alpha PHP prototype to the GOVUK Prototype kit. This prototype has two journeys for different users and I got the last of the two finished this week. Next week I can start working with the service designer to start making changes ready for beta testing.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Work on my current project is slowing down, just tying loose ends and waiting for the client to start testing and to give me a list of products. I asked for this list a while ago, the plan was that I'd have it for when I started coding the layout and the product details page, then I'd be working with real products - but this has not happened as planned.</p>
<p>Next week will mostly be testing and so more finishing touches. Plus any changes once the client starts testing it themselves.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Met up with <a href="https://twitter.com/benjystanton" title="Benjy Stanton on Twitter">Benjy Stanton</a> for a coffee at Black Sheep in Manchester while he was visiting the <a href="https://twitter.com/Swirrl" title="Swirrl on Twitter">Swirrl</a> HQ where he has recently started working. Was great to finally meet up in real life.</p>
<p>We had friends staying with us for the entire Easter weekend which was great. Lots of eating and drinking, kids playing in the garden and the dog running around after them. Had our first BBQ of the year (like a lot of people I'm guessing because the weather was great).</p>

      <p>This weeks 'weeknotes' is being posted a bit later than usual. I was supposed to write it on the train up to Manchester on Sunday evening, but I still can't get used to working on a laptop on the train.</p>
<p>Since returning my phone for repair and being reset to factory settings (I knew this was going to happen) I lost the podcasts I had subscribed to and the progress - I assumed it would have been backed up - but it wasn't. I've now signed up for an account with the Podcast Republic app I use, so this won't happen again and am back to listening to podcasts on my long commutes to Manchester.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>This week was the first full week in Manchester and on the project - which means I took part in a long user mapping session and my first retrospective and show &amp; tell of this project.</p>
<p>I spent most of my time that week, when not in meetings, rebuilding a prototype that was made in the Alpha stage of this project using the GOVUK Prototype kit - it was originally done in PHP.</p>
<p>The developers on the team have been helping me a lot with things like 'git rebase' and also learning to be a good collaborator - so I've been learning about how to do better commit messages.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>This week I spent some more time on my current freelance project, getting near the end of this e-commerce website. So there are some tidy up changes I've been working on.</p>
<p>Things like showing a 'no-product-image' when the product doesn't have an image, styling the Pay with card (stripe) button and form, re-coded the static 'basket' page, so it uses the same code as the non-static version of the basket page.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>Got to spend some time working on the garden this weekend, spent time with my children and I put together a new trampoline, also had to cut down a tree - its been almost horizontal since we moved here five years ago and we were told, its a splitting willow, so it needed to be cut down or it will fall.</p>
<p>It's been fine all these years, but because the trampoline was going under it, I couldn't risk it. But my chainsaw is still out of action, so I had to use a hand saw and cut it down about half way up - my son loved shouting timer as we pulled the tree down!</p>
<h2>Watching</h2>
<p>Finished re-watching The Office (US) this week - loved re-watching this again. I was a bit lost with what to replace it with, but have gone back to watching Straight Off the Boat - started watching it a long while ago, I just realised it is now on the 5th season.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>This week I was in Manchester for my new contract. I was only there for two days for the project kick off and tech setup.</p>
<p>Monday and Tuesday was a blur. I couldn't focus on anything. I did some of my freelance work. Friday was pretty much spent on the train coming back from Manchester.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>The first day was spent getting to know the project, colleagues and getting my machine set up to work with the GOVUK prototype kit as well as the project tech setup - which is Ruby on Rails - something I've never worked with before.</p>
<p>We had a bit of trouble updating Ruby from the system version, at first we thought it was because I was using Fish Shell and I didn't know what I was doing with it. But it wasn't. We ended up installing rbenv - a ruby version management tool, which just switches ruby to whatever version the project is using.</p>
<p>Then I added the GOVUK prototype kit to the app and had my first PR merged! I got all this done with a lot of help from a colleague, Meyric, the front-end developer on the project.</p>
<p>I'm very excited about this project but also to be finally working with the GOVUK prototype kit and working as an interaction designer again.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>Not a lot of progress made on the e-commerce project. I spent some time tidying up the product details page. Specifically, styling the price/sale price module. So if the product is on sale, it shows the previous price, with &quot;was&quot; before and it has a line through, with the word &quot;now&quot; and the new price.</p>
<p>It's one of those things you have to do, but don't know if the client will ever see or use it.</p>
<p>I also added some if else statements for product details, like height, weight etc, if those aren't populated, then I don't want to show an empty section on the page.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Another week that I haven't read any fiction books. This happens when I have loads of work on, I end up working in the evenings and then watch some TV before going to bed.</p>
<h2>Watching</h2>
<p>My wife and I have finished watching the second series of Travellers - we really liked the first two series and hope they carry on making it. We've also gone back to watching Sabrina, we stopped watching it for a bit, but we're back on it. Also carried on watching Blindspot - but this is getting to the point where they just need to end it, it is still good, but if they carry on stretching it, it won't be so good.</p>
<p>I've carried on watching Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Office (US) - love these two series, so funny.</p>
<h2>Family</h2>
<p>We got a new addition to our family - another pet - a snake. My eldest is going to be eleven at the end of the month and she's been wanting a snake for a while now. She originally wanted a corn snake, but they'd sold out. So she went for a Royal Python instead. Shes spent a few days choosing a name for him. I set up the vivarium for her as she was at a friends birthday party. We already had the vivarium and most of the kit needed as I had a bearded dragon until recently.</p>

      <p>This week started with me handing in my notice. I felt very guilty about ending my contract early, I managed 5 out of 12 weeks - it's the first time I have ever had to end a contract early.</p>
<p>Booked hotel and train ticket for Manchester for my next contract and part of me was feeling anxious. What if this doesn't work out, I'll be out of pocket and jobless - my mind kept repeating.</p>
<p>Oh I don't think I've mentioned - I'll be working as an Interaction Designer with DXW for the Department for Education.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>My last week at work was spent finishing off one of the two work orders that I was given in my third week. The first two weeks there I didn't have any work - as I mentioned before.</p>
<p>This work item ended up having loads of bugs because it was a real mess when it was given to me. Three developers before me had been involved with it and they have all left the company before I joined. Documentation was at least three months out of date. No one knew anything about what needed doing. My job was to move it from DEV to QA - oh and by the way, there's no version control!</p>
<p>Anyway, I managed to get the work done and all the bugs fixed and had time left to write up some handover documentation.</p>
<h2>Freelance</h2>
<p>I didn't get as much work done on my freelance project as I would like to have, but I've almost finished styling the basket and the product detail pages. Also started work on the register/login page - been working out whether its best to have both the register and log in on the same page, using tabs or to send users to a register page, with a link to log in for existing members.</p>
<p>This week notes is going to be a short one and it's late as well - it has been a weird week.</p>

      <p>Well, it was another uneventful and unproductive week - I've been distracted all week.</p>
<h2>Decisions</h2>
<p>I've decided to finish my current contract early. I've never done this and I have mixed feelings about it, but I know that I am not happy here and I don't see it getting better.</p>
<p>I had brief chat with the web development manager - I wasn't prepared for it, he just popped over to my desk and said can we have a chat. If I had been prepared I may have been more open about how I was feeling, I did explain how it's been difficult to get any work done because of how the DEV and QA environments are set up. He was understanding about it and knows its a problem, but it's not an overnight fix. He also said that the project I was supposed to be on was likely to be put on hold.</p>
<p>That told me that it was time to move on. All I've been doing there, when I've had work to do, is bug fixing. Bug fixing is hard, its even harder when you don't know the systems or anything ever works, or that the fixes your trying to fix, have had two previous developers work on it and nobody knows what they did. But also it's not the type of work I became a contractor/freelancer for - that's what I was doing when I was a permanent employee.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, I'll be finishing my current contract on Friday and then I'm off to start a new contract the following week in Manchester. It's a month-long contract working as an Interaction Designer on a government project. More info next week.</p>
<p>I've wanted to get back into an interaction designer role for a while now and have also been trying to work in government as well. I'm hoping this contract, though short, will be the stepping stone into more work in government.</p>

<p>So this week note is shorter than usual, but that ok, my mind has been busy thinking about the future and what sort of work I want to do and don't even mention politics! What a week. Great to see so many people sign the #RevokeArticle50 petition - let's hope it makes a difference.</p>
<p>Until next week - have a great one.</p>

      <p>It's been another pretty uneventful week apart from all the wind we had here in the east - we lost yet another water butt.</p>
<p>This week I didn't do any JavaScript learning and I've not managed to continue reading any of the books I've started. Managed to make some more progress with my freelance project. Work-wise nothing much has changed or improved.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I finished a blog post and published it. I wrote Multiple blogs with Perch CMS'. A short blog post on how you can achieve having multiple blog posts on a website using the Perch CMS. It was also added to the Perchology newsletter. Yay, thank Clive.</p>
<h3>Freelance</h3>
<p>Made some great progress on my current freelance project this week - the online shop for a charity client. Now that I am working from home three days a week, I can do some work before and after I start my contract job.</p>
<p>I created and styled a mini basket to go on the header of the website to show how many items a user has in their basket. Mostly finished styling the product list. I'm using the new CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox. Using grid for the listing of the products and flexbox as a fallback. Also, using flexbox to align the product title and a mini add to basket button side by side. Yay, no floats!</p>
<h2>What didn't go so well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>I've just finished my third week at my new contract and things still haven't improved. I barely have any work to do and the work I do have, it's a struggle to get any of it done. The DEV and QA environments are constantly going down and if that hasn't gone down then the CMS won't work.</p>
<p>I started looking for a new contract but I don't think I can leave. The recruitment agency I use only pays 30 days from the date they receive the first invoice - I won't get paid for another few weeks, if I get another contract, I may end up with another recruitment agency that also has a 30-day payment term. The reason this is a problem is that I have run out of funds and I still have to pay my corporate tax.</p>
<p>So I'm going to speak with the Web Development Manager about this and see how that conversation goes. I keep getting told that this isn't normal. Also, the other contractor finished on Friday - his contract had been extended for another three months but he quit last week.</p>
<h3>Learning</h3>
<p>Didn't do any learning this week because I've started working from home I'm spending more time working on my freelance work.</p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>Fell off the exercise wagon again this week. I exercised on Monday, but On Wednesday my muscles were so sore I could barely walk. Also, I've now come down with a cold. I think I managed about a year and a half without getting a cold and now I'm back working in an office and I have a cold!</p>

      <h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>I managed to write a blog post this week and started a second one which is nearly ready to be published and they're both <em>not</em> personal! The hardest thing for me when it comes to writing is finding the time to write. I'm writing this on my phone while at the shops with my wife and daughter.</p>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>
<p>Made loads of progress on code academy's  Introduction to JavaScript course. I've done a few Intro to JS courses so I can make sure I really understand the basics. This week I learnt about arrays, scope, conditional statements,  and functions.</p>
<h3>Freelance</h3>
<p>Made a tiny bit of progress with the shop but it a big milestone. The checkout flow works end to end. Whoop! I also started coding and styling the basket page.</p>
<h3>Fixed Sublime Text</h3>
<p>Well not really Sublime itself, but since I started using the Nunjucks templating language with Eleventy I found that the Nunjucks syntax was no longer available to install via Package Control. I found it on github and found out how to manually install it. But then it wasn't detecting when I was editing a file with an .njk extension. So I cloned the nunjucks-systax repo and edited the file, added njk as a string under filetypes. I then removed all references to the other nunjucks syntax installs and added my own git repo to sublime, installed it and IT WORKS!</p>
<p>This means I can stop using VS Code. I've been using it for a few weeks now and its good, but I prefer Sublime, I'm so used to it - I struggled to get on with Code.</p>
<h2>What didn't go well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Work didn't start off great. I was hoping that after a week without any work I'd come in Monday and have work to do - but that wasn't the case. The QA environment still wasn't ready for the next lot of fixes to go in. Finally got the go-ahead on Wednesday after lunch. I could add the code for the bug fixes but I still wasn't able to see those changes on the front end.</p>
<p>The rest of the week was spent working on two big fixes across multiple sites. But I wasn't able to test any of my changes or hand over to QA for testing.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed I'll continue having work to do or I'm able to do the project work I was hired to work on.</p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>Haven't done any exercise since I twisted my foot and ankle. It's felt weird not doing any exercise, which is a good thing. I plan on starting again next week.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
      <p>It's been another tiring week, but I felt it went by fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Tiring because I did about ten hours of driving this week to my new contract. It's in Lowestoft and it takes me about an hour and 10 mins each way. I will only have to do this for a couple of weeks  - after that, I will work remotely three days a week.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Made some progress with my freelance project - the online shop - but not as much as I'd hoped to get done - but with the driving to and from work, it hasn't left me with much spare time to work on this.</p>
<p>But I have managed to iron out some bugs and find a few more. I'm now at the final stage of the customer flow through the checkout process. Just need to get the system to successfully place an order and then I can start working on the front-end code and design.</p>
<p>Even though I didn't manage to get much coding or design done, I did manage to sketch out some wireframes for the layouts and I also sketched the flows for the user journeys. Good old pen and paper!</p>
<h3>Personal</h3>
<p>All the new carpet has been laid upstairs now. My wife also took this opportunity to sort through the kids' toys, clothes and books <em>Marie Kondo</em> style. Glad to say this is also over. I also finished sorting out the new vivarium for our tortoise - a huge six by four-foot box now sits in our living room (<em>we have a few pets!</em>).</p>
<p>Had to rush around the day before the carpet was being laid down on the upstairs hallway to get some network cable under the floorboards from the airing cupboard for me to wire in a Ubiquiti wifi access point, that will be mounted on the ceiling. Bit of a challenge - most of the rectangular floorboards had already been cut by electricians, but I needed to get the network cable to go under a floorboard that wasn't cut. I cut a hole in the airing cupboard floor, used a metal wire, looped over a water pipe to slide along until the gap where the floorboard had been lifted and then I could pull the network cable through!</p>
<h3>Writting</h3>
<p>I also managed to get a blog post out but it wasn't web design related, I wrote about my ventures into <a href="https://www.juanfernandes.uk/blog/home-automation/" title="Home Automation">home automation</a> - but I don't think this was well received. I need to get  back into writting more about web design stuff and less personal.</p>
<h2>What didn't go well</h2>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>So I had my first week at my new job and it wasn't what I expected. I basically didn't do any work the entire week.</p>
<p>As a contractor, I'm used to arriving at a new job and having work to do. Even if I came in at the beginning of a project, which is the ideal time to start a new contract but not always possible, there is still project work to do, even if it's not coding.</p>
<p>But what I've been doing was labelled as <em>training</em>. So I spent all week reviewing existing code - seeing how the front-end code works with the backend, their templating language and use of variables. Also learning about all the different websites, environments and processes.</p>
<p>I'm told next week I'll be working on bug fixes until the project work can start - this is not ideal, but its better than <em>training</em>. I'm hoping this won't last more than a week and it helps me gain useful knowledge about the sites I will be working on when the project does start.</p>
<p>It's been hard getting used to working on a windows machine again after a very long time - at my last contract, I think I lasted a month before I switched to working on my Linux laptop, but I won't be able to do that here.</p>
<h2>Until next week</h2>
<p>I'm hoping next week I will be able to get more work done on the online shop project as I get more used to the daily driving and actually get stuck into the front-end code and design work of the project.</p>

      <p>This week has been a busy one - with the housework and a new freelance project.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of furniture moving around while the new carpets were fitted. While all this was going on I started working on a new freelance project - an online shop being added to an existing website using Perch CMS and the Perch Shop app.</p>
<p>It's been a long while since I built an online shop and this has been a slow start due to the lack of documentation and nothing seemed to work from the get-go.</p>
<p>I feel like my weeknotes have mostly been about personal stuff but that will change soon as I start a new contract on Monday.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>As I mentioned I started a new freelance project - an online shop to be added to an existing website for a charity.</p>
<p>I've built a few websites using the Perch CMS and have also installed a few add-on apps, like a blog and members area. But with the shop app, it's not been as straight forward as with the other apps.</p>
<p>For a start, the documentation is a bit on the weak side and for me nothing working from the start.</p>
<p>Product listing worked, but product details and add to cart didn't work, it's been a very slow start. But with the help of the Perch slack channel and the forum I've got as far as seeing a shopping cart with items in it. Next stage is the checkout process.</p>
<h2>What didn't go well</h2>
<h3>This website</h3>
<p>I still haven't gotten any further with my website. I won't be able to get any more changes done to it for a while now I'm starting a new contract and with a freelance project in the side as well.</p>
<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p>If you read my 2018 Year In Review post, you'll know I started the Joe Wickes 90 Day Plan. Well, it's taking longer than 90 days because of Christmas and my trip to Nottingham for New Adventures conference. Last week I got a pain in my shoulder, not during exercise, but a while after, so I stopped exercising for a few days, but I had a lot of furniture to move around.</p>
<p>Saturday I decided to get back to my exercise again and just at the end while running on the spot, my foot came down onto the bottom of the sofa and I twisted my foot and ankle really badly - so much so that I thought I had broken a bone. Exercise is bad for me!</p>

      <p>This week I'm starting with what didn't go well, as it was a bit of a blow for me. I'm also introducing a personal section because I like writing about my personal life on my blog, so felt it was appropriate - it also explains why I didn't get much work done on my website!</p>
<h2>What didn't go well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Last week this was in the 'what went well' section because I'd gotten a new contract, fully remote and working for an agency, which is something that I've been wanting for a while.</p>
<p>But it wasn't meant to be.</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I read a few articles - but I want to read at least 2 a day and I didn't manage read any more of Eloquent JavaScript or Stephen Kings The Dark Tower - I'm on book number five.</p>
<h3>This website</h3>
<p>Once again I didn't get any spare time to work on my website. As I mentioned before I converting it from PHP to using a static site generator. I did manage to create a whole bunch of issues on my gitlab repo - this means I will be able to work an issue at a time, rather than looking at &quot;Personal Website&quot; on my to-do list.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the week, I secured a new contract (yay!) - this is due to start on the 25th. I'll be working with Hoseasons. Very excited to get back to work, looking forward to new challenges and working with a new team.</p>
<h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
<p>This week I started a new course - Introduction to JavaScript by CodeAcademy. It started off with a lot of basic stuff I already knew and I thought it may have been too basic, but I soon started learning new things. I also have a bit of a learning roadmap put together, so I know what I need to learn next.</p>
<h2>Personal</h2>
<p>I've spent a lot of time this week not doing web design things, but instead I've been doing some DIY. Next week we are having new carpet fitted in the whole of the upstairs and we decided that we didn't like the skirting boards being so dark (dark mahogany) and decided to paint them white. This took a while as I had to do 2 coats of undercoat and then 2 coats of the white paint.</p>
<p>Also, my son managed to break his bedroom door through slamming it open (and shut) too many times! The wood frame where the hinge is attached cracked and I wasn't able to repair the crack. So I ended up removing a lot of the decorative part of the frame, then cut the main part of the door frame in half and replace it with a new piece of wood and now its all back. Just needs a few coats of paint now thatI've filled and sanded the nail holes.</p>

      <p>My first <a href="https://weeknot.es/" title="Weeknotes">#weeknotes</a>. I really like the idea of these - just like the yearly reviews - so why not a weekly review.</p>
<p>I’m hoping this will help me, not only with getting into the habit of writing but also make my weeks more productive as I look back and see what did and didn’t work well.</p>
<p>I also like the idea of sharing articles I’ve read each week - not strictly part of the weeknotes thing, but I’ve seen other people do it.</p>
<h2>What went well</h2>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>I delighted to say I have secured a 3-month contract, starting on Wednesday the 13th. This working for an agency based in Leicester. It will also be my first fully remote contract. This is something I wanted to achieve this year, in the hopes that it will make it easier to get more remote work in the future. I’ve also been wanting to work for an agency for a while now - very exciting.</p>
<h3>Learning JavaScript</h3>
<p>This week I finished reading <a href="https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers" title="JavaScript for Web Designers">JavaScript for Web Designers by Mat Marquis</a> - it’s a great intro to JavaScript which has left me wanting more. I’m now reading <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" title="Eloquent JavaScript">Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke</a>. I also finished the 20 free lessons on <a href="https://learnjavascript.online/" title="Learn JavaScript Online">Learn JavaScript Online</a> - I love how this has been done and I do plan on buying the rest of the lessons once I get more funds! I love that as part of it, there is a flashcards app - I found this very useful for recapping what I’d learnt. I’m now going through code academy’s Introduction to Javascript course.</p>
<h2>What didn't go well</h2>
<h3>This website</h3>
<p>This week I didn’t manage to do any work on my website. I’m currently converting it from PHP and CMS to a static site, using <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" title="Eleventy">Eleventy</a> as my static site generator. I originally built my site in PHP and used Perch CMS - this was done so I could use my site to test new Perch features that I could use on client websites, but I find I’m not doing any small freelance jobs at the moment and most likely won't - so I decided to learn something new and deep dive into Eleventy.</p>
<p>I’ve waiting to finish my site so I can start writing these weeknotes and blogging more, but I think its just been an excuse!</p>
