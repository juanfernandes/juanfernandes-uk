      In yesterday&rsquo;s article on loading HTML from another page, I talked about progressively enhancing a link into a button. Let’s imagine you have a dialog modal that loads some HTML. You might keep all that HTML in a separate file, and by default display a link to it. &lt;a href=&#34;/terms&#34;&gt;Read the Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt;  When your JS loads, you can progressively enhance it into a modal toggle.

      In typography, an orphan or widow is a single word on its own line. It can look particularly unpleasing with headings, and is hard to &ldquo;plan for&rdquo; on the web, where people view your site on a wide range of viewport sizes. You can avoid them by manually added a non-breaking space (&amp;nbsp;) before the second and last word in every sentence, but doing that manually is madness. &lt;h2&gt;How to use the Array.
